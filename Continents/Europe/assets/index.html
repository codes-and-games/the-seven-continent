                Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the
                giant
                Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the
                term
                to describe such a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among
                the
                regions it encompasses. Asia has both the highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has
                the
                longest coastline of any continent, is subject overall to the world’s widest climatic extremes, and,
                consequently, produces the most varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth. In addition,
                the
                peoples of Asia have established the broadest variety of human adaptation found on any of the
                continents.<br><br><br><br><br>

        <p data-aos="fade-up"
            style="padding-right: 12px;  text-align:center; position:relative; left:8px; bottom:320px;">
            The name Asia is ancient, and its origin has been variously explained. The Greeks used it to designate
            the lands situated to the east of their homeland. It is believed that the name may be derived from the
            Assyrian word asu, meaning “east.” Another possible explanation is that it was originally a local name
            given to the plains of Ephesus, which ancient Greeks and Romans extended to refer first to Anatolia
            (contemporary Asia Minor, which is the western extreme of mainland Asia), and then to the known world
            east of the Mediterranean Sea. When Western explorers reached South and East Asia in early modern times,
            they extended that label to the whole of the immense landmass.<br><br>
            Asia is bounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Indian Ocean to the
            south, the Red Sea (as well as the inland seas of the Atlantic Ocean—the Mediterranean and the Black) to
            the southwest, and Europe to the west. Asia is separated from North America to the northeast by the
            Bering Strait and from Australia to the southeast by the seas and straits connecting the Indian and
            Pacific oceans. The Isthmus of Suez unites Asia with Africa, and it is generally agreed that the Suez
            Canal forms the border between them. Two narrow straits, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, separate
            Anatolia from the Balkan Peninsula.

                The land boundary between Asia and Europe is a historical and cultural construct that has been
                defined
                variously; only as a matter of agreement is it tied to a specific borderline. The most convenient
                geographic boundary—one that has been adopted by most geographers—is a line that runs south from the
                Arctic Ocean along the Ural Mountains and then turns southwest along the Emba River to the northern
                shore of the Caspian Sea; west of the Caspian, the boundary follows the Kuma-Manych Depression to
                the
                Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait of the Black Sea. Thus, the isthmus between the Black and Caspian
                seas,
                which culminates in the Caucasus mountain range to the south, is part of Asia.

            The total area of Asia, including Asian Russia (with the Caucasian isthmus) but excluding the island of
            New Guinea, amounts to some 17,226,200 square miles (44,614,000 square km), roughly one-third of the
            land surface of Earth. The islands—including Taiwan, those of Japan and Indonesia, Sakhalin and other
            islands of Asian Russia, Sri Lanka, Cyprus, and numerous smaller islands—together constitute 1,240,000
            square miles (3,210,000 square km), about 7 percent of the total. (Although New Guinea is mentioned
            occasionally in this article, it generally is not considered a part of Asia.) The farthest terminal
            points of the Asian mainland are Cape Chelyuskin in north-central Siberia, Russia (77°43′ N), to the
            north; the tip of the Malay Peninsula, Cape Piai, or Bulus (1°16′ N), to the south; Cape Baba in Turkey
            (26°4′ E) to the west; and Cape Dezhnev (Dezhnyov), or East Cape (169°40′ W), in northeastern Siberia,
            overlooking the Bering Strait, to the east.<br>
            Asia has the highest average elevation of the continents and contains the greatest relative relief. The
            tallest peak in the world, Mount Everest, which reaches an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see
            Researcher’s Note: Height of Mount Everest); the lowest place on Earth’s land surface, the Dead Sea,
            measured in the mid-2010s at about 1,410 feet (430 metres) below sea level; and the world’s deepest
            continental trough, occupied by Lake Baikal, which is 5,315 feet (1,620 metres) deep and whose bottom
            lies 3,822 feet (1,165 metres) below sea level, are all located in Asia. Those physiographic extremes
            and the overall predominance of mountain belts and plateaus are the result of the collision of tectonic
            plates. In geologic terms, Asia comprises several very ancient continental platforms and other blocks of
            land that merged over the eons. Most of those units had coalesced as a continental landmass by about 160
            million years ago, when the core of the Indian subcontinent broke off from Africa and began drifting
            northeastward to collide with the southern flank of Asia about 50 million to 40 million years ago. The
            northeastward movement of the subcontinent continues at about 2.4 inches (6 cm) per year. The impact and
            pressure continue to raise the Plateau of Tibet and the Himalayas.<br>Asia’s coastline—some 39,000 miles
            (62,800 km) in length—is, variously, high and mountainous, low and
            alluvial, terraced as a result of the land’s having been uplifted, or “drowned” where the land has
            subsided. The specific features of the coastline in some areas—especially in the east and southeast—are
            the result of active volcanism; thermal abrasion of permafrost (caused by a combination of the action of
            breaking waves and thawing), as in northeastern Siberia; and coral growth, as in the areas to the south
            and southeast. Accreting sandy beaches also occur in many areas, such as along the Bay of Bengal and the
            Gulf of Thailand.<br>
            The mountain systems of Central Asia not only have provided the continent’s great rivers with water from
            their melting snows but also have formed a forbidding natural barrier that has influenced the movement
            of peoples in the area. Migration across those barriers has been possible only through mountain passes.
            A historical movement of population from the arid zones of Central Asia has followed the mountain passes
            into the Indian subcontinent. More recent migrations have originated in China, with destinations
            throughout Southeast Asia. The Korean and Japanese peoples and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese have
            remained ethnically more homogeneous than the populations of other Asian countries.<br>
            Asia’s population is unevenly distributed, mainly because of climatic factors. There is a concentration
            of population in western Asia as well as great concentrations in the Indian subcontinent and the eastern
            half of China. There are also appreciable concentrations in the Pacific borderlands and on the islands,
            but vast areas of Central and North Asia—whose forbidding climates limit agricultural productivity—have
            remained sparsely populated. Nonetheless, Asia, the most populous of the continents, contains some
            three-fifths of the world’s people.<br>
            Asia is the birthplace of all the world’s major religions—Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and
            Judaism—and of many minor ones. Of those, only Christianity developed primarily outside of Asia; it
            exerts little influence on the continent, though many Asian countries have Christian minorities.
            Buddhism has had a greater impact outside its birthplace in India and is prevalent in various forms in
            China, South Korea, Japan, the Southeast Asian countries, and Sri Lanka. Islam has spread out of Arabia
            eastward to South and Southeast Asia. Hinduism has been mostly confined to the Indian subcontinent.

                Asia is not only Earth’s largest continent but also its youngest and structurally most-complicated
                one.
                Although Asia’s evolution began almost four billion years ago, more than half of the continent
                remains
                seismically active, and new continental material is currently being produced in the island arc
                systems
                that surround it to the east and southeast. In such places, new land is continuously emerging and is
                added to the bulk of the continent by episodic collisions of the island arcs with the mainland. Asia
                also contains the greatest mountain mass on Earth’s surface: the Plateau of Tibet and the bordering
                mountains of the Himalayas, Karakoram Range, Hindu Kush, Pamirs, Kunlun Mountains, and Tien Shan. By
                virtue of its enormous size and relative youth, Asia contains many of the morphological extremes of
                Earth’s land surface—such as its highest and lowest points, longest coastline, and largest area of
                continental shelf. Asia’s immense mountain ranges, varied coastline, and vast continental plains and
                basins have had a profound effect on the course of human history. The fact that Asia produces vast
                quantities of fossil fuels—petroleum, natural gas, and coal—in addition to being a significant
                contributor to the global production of many minerals (e.g., about three-fifths of the world’s tin)
                heavily underlines the importance of its geology for the welfare of the world’s population.

            <p style="position:relative; bottom: 500px; text-align:center;">
                The morphology of Asia masks an extremely complex geologic history that predates the active
                deformations
                largely responsible for the existing landforms. Tectonic units (regions that once formed or now form
                part of a single tectonic plate and whose structures derive from the formation and motion of that
                plate)
                that are defined on the basis of active structures in Asia are not identical to those defined on the
                basis of its fossil (i.e., now inactive) structures. It is therefore convenient to discuss the
                tectonic
                framework of Asia in terms of two separate maps, one showing its paleotectonic (i.e., older
                tectonic)
                units and the other displaying its neotectonic (new and presently active) units.According to the
                theory
                of plate tectonics, forces within Earth propel sections of its crust on various courses, with the
                result
                that continents are formed and oceans are opened and closed. Oceans commonly open by rifting—by
                tearing
                a continent asunder—and close along subduction zones, which are inclined planes along which ocean
                floors
                sink beneath an adjacent tectonic plate and are assimilated into Earth’s mantle. Ocean closure
                culminates in continental collision and may involve the accretion of vast tectonic collages,
                including
                small continental fragments, island arcs, large deposits of sediment, and occasional fragments of
                ocean-floor material. In defining the units to draw Asia’s paleotectonic map, it is useful to
                outline
                such accreted objects and the lines, or sutures, along which they are joined.Continuing convergence
                following collision may further disrupt an already assembled tectonic collage along new, secondary
                lines, especially by faulting. Postcollisional disruption also may reactivate some of the old
                tectonic
                lines (sutures). Those secondary structures dominate and define the neotectonic units of Asia. It
                should
                be mentioned, however, that most former continental collisions also have led to the generation of
                secondary structures that add to the structural diversity of the continent.The paleotectonic units
                of
                Asia are divided into two first-order classes: continental nuclei and orogenic (mountain-building)
                zones. The continental nuclei consist of platforms that stabilized mostly in Precambrian time
                (between
                roughly 4 billion and 541 million years ago) and have been covered largely by little-disturbed
                sedimentary rocks; included in that designation are the Angaran (or East Siberian), Indian, and
                Arabian
                platforms. There are also several smaller platforms that were deformed to a greater extent than the
                larger units and are called paraplatforms; those include the North China (or Sino-Korean) and
                Yangtze
                paraplatforms, the Kontum block (in Southeast Asia), and the North Tarim fragment (also called
                Serindia;
                in western China). The orogenic zones consist of large tectonic collages that were accreted around
                the
                continental nuclei. Recognized zones are the Altaids, the Tethysides (further subdivided into the
                Cimmerides and the Alpides), and the circum-Pacific belt. The Alpides and circum-Pacific belt are
                currently undergoing tectonic deformation—i.e., they are continuing to evolve—and so are the
                locations
                of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.The Precambrian continental nuclei were formed by essentially
                the
                same plate tectonic processes that constructed the later orogenic zones, but it is best to treat
                them
                separately for three reasons. First, the nuclei occupy only about one-fourth of the area of Asia,
                and
                less than one-third of that area (i.e., less than 10 percent of Asia’s total) consists of exposed
                Precambrian rocks that enable geologists to study their development. Second, Precambrian rocks are
                extremely poor in fossils, which makes global or even regional correlations difficult. Finally,
                during
                most of Phanerozoic time (i.e., about the past 541 million years), the nuclei have remained stable
                and
                have acted as hosts around which the tectonic collages have accumulated in the Phanerozoic orogenic
                zones.The paleotectonic evolution of Asia terminated some 40 to 50 million years ago as a result of
                the
                collision of the Indian subcontinent with Eurasia. Asia’s subsequent neotectonic development has
                largely
                disrupted the continent’s preexisting fabric. The first-order neotectonic units of Asia are Stable
                Asia,
                the Arabian and Indian cratons, the Alpide plate boundary zone (along which the Arabian and Indian
                platforms have collided with the Eurasian continental plate), and the island arcs and marginal
                basins.

            <p style="text-align:center; position:relative; bottom: 450px;">
                The oldest rocks in Asia are found in the continental nuclei. Rocks more than 3 billion years old
                are in
                the Precambrian outcrops of the Angaran and Indian platforms and in the North China paraplatform.
                They
                consist of primitive island-arc magmatic and sparse sedimentary rocks sandwiched between younger
                basaltic and ultrabasic rocks, exposed along what are called greenstone belts. The basement of the
                Angaran platform was largely formed by about 1.5 billion years ago. The final consolidation of the
                Indian platform, however, lasted until about 600 million years ago and included various
                mountain-building episodes with peaks of activity between 2.4 and 2.3 billion years ago, at about 2
                billion years ago, between 1.7 and 1.6 billion years ago, and between 1.1 billion and 600 million
                years
                ago. In the Arabian platform the formation of the present basement commenced by arc and
                microcontinent
                accretion some 900 million years ago and ended about 600 million years ago, although some of the
                accreted microcontinents had basements more than 2.5 billion years old and may be detached fragments
                of
                Africa.While other Asian continental nuclei were completing their consolidation, orogenic
                deformation
                recommenced along the present southeast and southwest margins of the Angaran platform. That renewed
                activity marked the beginning of a protracted period of subduction, the development of vast
                sedimentary
                piles scraped off sinking segments of ocean floor in subduction zones and accumulated in the form of
                subduction-accretion wedges at the leading edge of overriding plates, and subduction-related
                magmatism
                and numerous collisions in what today is known as Altaid Asia (named for the Altai Mountains).
                Orogenic
                deformation in the Altaids was essentially continuous from the late Proterozoic Eon (about 850
                million
                years ago) into the early part of the Mesozoic Era (about 220 million years ago), in some
                regions—such
                as Mongolia and Siberia—lasting even to the end of the Jurassic Period (about 145 million years
                ago).
                <br><br>
                The construction of the Altaid collage was coeval with the late Paleozoic assembly of the Pangea (or
                Pangaea) supercontinent (between about 320 and 250 million years ago). The Altaids lay to the north
                of
                the Paleo-Tethys Ocean (also called Paleo-Tethys Sea), a giant triangular eastward-opening embayment
                of
                Pangea. A strip of continental material was torn away from the southern margin of the Paleo-Tethys
                and
                migrated northward, rotating around the western apex of the Tethyan triangle much like the action of
                a
                windshield wiper. That continental strip, called the Cimmerian continent, was joined during its
                northward journey by a collage of continental material that had gathered around the Yangtze
                paraplatform
                and the Kontum block, and, between about 210 and 180 million years ago, all of that material
                collided
                with Altaid Asia to create the Cimmeride orogenic belt.
                While the Cimmerian continent was drifting northward, a new ocean, the Neo-Tethys, was opening
                behind it
                and north of the Gondwanaland supercontinent. The new ocean began closing some 155 million years
                ago,
                shortly after the beginning of the major disintegration of Gondwanaland. Two fragments of
                Gondwanaland,
                India and Arabia, collided with the rest of Asia during the Eocene (i.e., about 56 to 34 million
                years
                ago) and the Miocene (about 23 to 5.3 million years ago) epochs, respectively. The orogenic belts
                that
                arose from the destruction of the Neo-Tethys and the resultant continental collisions are called the
                Alpides and form the present Alpine-Himalayan mountain ranges. Both the Cimmerides and the Alpides
                resulted from the elimination of the Tethyan oceans, and collectively they are called the
                Tethysides.
                <br>
                Most of the island arcs fringing Asia to the east came into being by subduction of the Pacific Ocean
                floor and the opening of marginal basins behind those arcs during the Cenozoic Era (the past 66
                million
                years). That activity continues today and is the major source of tectonism (seismic and volcanic
                activity often resulting in uplift) in South and Southeast Asia. In the south and in the southwest,
                India and Arabia are continuing their northward march, moving at an average of about 2.4 and 1.6
                inches
                (6 and 4 cm), respectively, per year. Those movements have caused the massive distortion of the
                southern
                two-thirds of Asia and produced the nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges between Turkey and
                Myanmar (Burma) that in places widen into high plateaus in Turkey, Iran, and the Tibet Autonomous
                Region
                of China. Within and north of those plateaus, geologically young mountains such as the Caucasus and
                the
                Tien Shan, large strike-slip faults such as the North Anatolian and the Altun (Altyn Tagh), and rift
                valley basins such as Lake Baikal—all of which are associated with seismic activity—bear witness to
                the
                widespread effects of the convergence of Arabia and India with Stable Asia, in which no notable
                active
                tectonism is seen.

                Characteristic of the surface of Asia is the great predominance of mountains and plateaus,
                constituting
                about three-fourths of the continent’s total area. The mountains are grouped into two belts: those
                located on the stable platforms (cratons) and those located in active orogenic zones. The former
                usually
                occur on the margins of the platforms and generally are characterized by smooth eroded peaks and
                steep
                faulted slopes. Marginal mountain ranges, with average heights of 8,200 to 9,850 feet (2,500 to
                3,000
                metres), usually enclose the inner tablelands and plateaus; examples of such ranges include the
                Western
                and Eastern Ghats in India, the mountains of the Hejaz and Yemeni highlands on the Arabian
                Peninsula,
                and the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains in the Levant. The Aldan Plateau and Stanovoy Range lie
                along
                the eastern margin of the Angaran (Siberian) platform, where the isolated and uplifted Putoran
                Mountains
                are located in central Siberia.Mountains of the orogenic zones are much higher in elevation and have
                a
                more-complicated structure. Tectonic movements in those zones have given rise to structures of
                different
                age and composition. Mesozoic and Cenozoic foldings (i.e., those of roughly the past 250 million
                years)
                created boundaries between basic types of mountains over vast areas of Asia. The largest mountain
                belt
                on Mesozoic structures (i.e., from about 252 to 66 million years ago) extends from the Chukchi
                Peninsula
                at the eastern extremity of Asia through the Kolyma Upland and the Dzhugdzhur and Stanovoy ranges to
                the
                mountains of southern Siberia (the Sayan and the Altai mountains) and to the Tien Shan and
                Gissar-Alay
                ranges. The Chersky and Verkhoyansk ranges are the western spurs of that belt.Along the edges of the
                Central Asian plateaus extend the elongated mountain chains of the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan),
                Taihang, and Daxue ranges. The Hinggan-Bureya mountains (Xiao Hinggan [Lesser Khingan] and Bureya
                ranges) demarcate the Zeya-Bureya Depression. The Manchurian-Korean and Sikhote-Alin mountain ranges
                separate the plains of the Amur and Sungari (Songhua) rivers, the Lake Khanka lowland, and the
                Northeast
                (Manchurian) Plain. The coastal ranges in the southeast consist of the mountains of southern China
                and
                the Annamese Cordillera. A generally latitudinal branch springs from the Pamirs region and runs
                eastward
                through the Kunlun, Qilian, and Qin (Tsinling) mountains.The Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt runs in
                a
                west-east direction and includes the Taurus Mountains, the Caucasus, the Zagros and Elburz
                mountains,
                the Hindu Kush, the Pamirs, the Karakoram Range, the Plateau of Tibet, and the Himalayas; it then
                turns
                to the south and southeast, running through the Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains to the islands of the
                Malay
                Archipelago. The western part of that belt consists, for a considerable distance, of two series of
                mountain chains that converge in dense knots in the Armenian Highland, in the Pamirs, and in the
                southeast of the Plateau of Tibet; the two chains then diverge to encompass the interior plateaus.
                The
                average elevation of highlands and marginal ranges increases from west to east from about 2,600 to
                3,000

                Mountains of the Kamchatka-Koryak arc along the Sredinny (Central) range on the Kamchatka Peninsula
                of
                Russia. The marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean are bordered by the East Asian islands, which
                form the line of arcs running from the Kamchatka Peninsula in the north to the Sunda Islands of
                Indonesia in the south. Many of those islands are part of the Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanic and
                seismic activity in the Pacific Rim.

                Low plains occupy the rest of the Asian mainland, particularly the vast West Siberian and Turan
                plains
                of the interior. The remaining lowlands are distributed either in the maritime regions—such as the
                North
                Siberian and Yana-Indigirka lowlands and the North China Plain—or in the piedmont depressions of
                Mesopotamia, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and mainland Southeast Asia. Those plains have monotonously
                level
                surfaces with wide valleys, through which the great Asian rivers and their tributaries flow. The
                topography of the plains in densely populated regions has been greatly modified through the
                construction
                of canals, dams, and levees. To the south of the zone of piedmont depressions lie extensive
                tablelands
                and plateaus, including the Deccan plateau in India and the Syrian-Arabian Plateau in the west. In
                addition, there are the intermontane basins of Kashgaria, Junggar, Qaidam (Tsaidam), and Fergana and
                the
                plateaus of central Siberia and the Gobi, all of which lie at elevations of 2,600 to 4,900 feet (800
                to
                1,500 metres). Most of their surfaces are smooth or gently rolling, with isolated hillocks. The
                plateaus
                inside the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, the Tien Shan, and the Pamirs lie at elevations of some
                12,000 feet (3,700 metres) or more.

                The contemporary relief of Asia was molded primarily under the influences of (1) ancient
                processes
                of planation (leveling), (2) larger vertical movements of the surface during the Cenozoic Era,
                and
                (3) severe erosive dissection of the edges of the uplifted highlands with the accompanying
                accumulation of alluvium in low-lying troughs, which were either settling downward or being
                uplifted
                more slowly than the adjoining heights.The interior portions of the uplifted highlands and the
                plateaus and tablelands of peninsular India, Arabia, Syria, and eastern Siberia—all of which are
                relatively low-lying but composed of resistant rock—largely have preserved their ancient peneplaned
                (i.e., leveled) surfaces. Particularly spectacular uplifting occurred in Central Asia, where the
                amplitude of uplift of the mountain ranges of Tibet and of the Pamirs and the Himalayas has exceeded
                13,000 feet (4,000 metres). The eastern margin of the highlands, meanwhile, underwent subsidences of
                up to 2,300 feet (700 metres). Uplifting as a result of fractures at great depths, of which the
                Kopet-Dag and ranges surrounding the Fergana Valley provide typical examples, and of folding over a
                large radius, examples of which may be seen in the Tien Shan and Gissar and Alay ranges, played a
                significant role.Erosional dissection transformed many ancient plateaus into mountainous regions.
                Majestic gorges were carved into the highlands of the western Pamirs and southeastern Tibet; the
                Himalayas, the Kunlun and Sayan mountains, the Stanovoy and Chersky ranges, and the marginal ranges
                of the West Asian highlands were deeply cut by the rivers, which created deep superimposed gorges
                and canyons.Vast areas of Middle, Central, and East Asia, particularly in the Huang He (Yellow
                River) basin, are covered with loess (a loamy unstratified deposit formed by wind or by glacial
                meltwater deposition); the thickness of the deposits on the Loess Plateau of China sometimes exceeds
                1,000 feet (300 metres). There are broad expanses of badlands, eolian (wind-produced) relief, and
                karst topography (limestone terrain associated with vertical and underground drainage). Karst
                terrain is characteristic of the Kopet-Dag, the eastern Pamirs, the Tien Shan, the Gissar and Alay
                ranges, the Ustyurt Plateau, the western Taurus Mountains, and the Levant. Tropical karst (limestone
                landscape) in South China is renowned for its picturesque residual hills.<br><br>

                The mantle of glaciation from the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago)
                embraced northwestern Asia only to latitude 60° N. East of the Khatanga River, which flows from
                Siberia into the Arctic Ocean, only isolated glaciation of the mantle debris and of the mountains
                occurred, because of the extremely dry climate that existed in northeastern Asia even at that time.
                The high mountain regions experienced primarily mountain glaciation. There are traces of several
                periods during which the glaciers advanced—periods separated by warmer interglacial epochs.
                Glaciation continues in many of the mountainous areas and on the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. The
                Karakoram Range, the Pamirs, the Tien Shan, the Himalayas, and the eastern Hindu Kush are noted for
                the immensity of their contemporary glaciers. Most of the glaciers are retreating. The elevation of
                the permanent snow line is relatively high, averaging between 14,800 and 16,400 feet (4,500 and
                5,000 metres) and reaching 21,000 feet (6,400 metres) in central Tibet.<br><br>

                An enormous area of permafrost—some 4.25 million square miles (11 million square km)—covers northern
                Asia and extends to lower latitudes there than anywhere else in the world. Little snowfall occurs,
                because of the aridity, and deep freezing of the soil takes place. The depth of the permafrost in
                continental northern and eastern Siberia exceeds 1,000 to 1,300 feet (300 to 400 metres).Volcanism
                has added broad lava plateaus and chains of young volcanic cones to the relief of Asia. Ancient
                lavas and intrusions of magma, exposed by later erosion, cover the terraced plateaus of peninsular
                India and central Siberia. Extensive zones of young volcanic relief and contemporary volcanism,
                however, are confined to the unstable arcs of the East Asian islands, together with the Kamchatka
                Peninsula, the Philippines, and the Sunda Islands. The highest active volcano in Asia,
                Klyuchevskaya, rises to 15,584 feet (4,750 metres) on Kamchatka.Geologically recent volcanism is
                also characteristic of the West Asian highlands, the Caucasus, Mongolia, the Manchurian-Korean
                mountains, and the Syrian-Arabian Plateau. In historical times eruptions also occurred in the
                interior of the continent in the Xiao Hinggan Range and the Anyuy highlands.

                It is common practice in geographic literature to divide Asia into large regions, each grouping
                together a number of countries. Those physiographic divisions usually consist of North Asia,
                including the bulk of Siberia and the northeastern edges of the continent; East Asia, including the
                continental part of the Russian Far East region of Siberia, the East Asian islands, Korea, and
                eastern and northeastern China; Central Asia, including the Plateau of Tibet, the Junggar and Tarim
                basins, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, the Gobi, and the Sino-Tibetan ranges; Middle
                Asia, including the Turan Plain, the Pamirs, the Gissar and Alay ranges, and the Tien Shan; South
                Asia, including the Philippine and Malay archipelagoes, peninsular Southeast Asia and peninsular
                India, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and the Himalayas; and West (or Southwest) Asia, including the West
                Asian highlands (Anatolia, Armenia, and Iran), the Levant, and the Arabian Peninsula. Sometimes the
                Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, and peninsular Southeast Asia, instead of being considered part
                of South Asia, are grouped separately as Southeast Asia. Yet another variation of the basic
                categories is commonly made to divide Asia into its cultural regions.<br><br>

                Northeastern Siberia comprises faulted and folded mountains of moderate height, such as the
                Verkhoyansk,
                Chersky, and Okhotsk-Chaun mountain arcs, all Mesozoic structures that have been rejuvenated by
                geologically recent tectonic events. The Koryak Mountains are similar but have a Cenozoic origin.
                Volcanic activity took place in those areas during the Cenozoic. Some plateaus are found in the
                areas of
                the ancient massifs, such as the Kolyma Mountains. Traces of several former centres of mountain
                glaciers
                remain, as well as traces of lowland originally covered by the sea, such as the New Siberian
                Islands.
                The Prilenskoye and Aldan plateaus—comprising an ancient peneplain resting on the underlying
                platform
                that sometimes outcrops on the surface—are located in the region. Traces of ancient glaciation also
                can
                be distinguished.The dominant feature of north-central Siberia is the Central Siberian Plateau, a
                series of plateaus and stratified plains that were uplifted in the Cenozoic. They are composed of
                terraced and dissected mesas with exposed horizontal volcanic intrusions, plains formed from
                uplifted Precambrian blocks, and a young uplifted mesa, dissected at the edges and partly covered
                with traprock (Putoran Mountains). On the eastern periphery is the Central Yakut Lowland, the
                drainage basin of the lower Lena River, and on the northern periphery is the North Siberian Lowland,
                covered with its original marine deposits.The West Siberian Plain is stratified and is composed of
                Cenozoic sediments deposited over thicknesses of Mesozoic material, in addition to folded bedrock.
                The northern part was subjected to several periods of glaciation throughout the Quaternary Period
                (the past 2.6 million years). In the south, glaciofluvial and fluvial deposits predominate.In the
                northern part of the region are the mountains and islands of the Asian Arctic. The archipelago of
                Severnaya Zemlya is formed of fragments of fractured Paleozoic folded structures. Throughout the
                region there has been vigorous contemporary glaciation.</p><br><br>

                The main features in the northern region of East Asia include the Da Hinggan, Xiao Hinggan, and
                Bureya ranges; the Zeya-Bureya Depression and the Sikhote-Alin ranges; the lowlands of the Amur and
                Sungari rivers and Lake Khanka; the Manchurian-Korean highlands running along North Korea’s border
                with China; the ranges extending along the eastern side of the Korean peninsula; the Northeast
                (Manchurian) Plain; the lowlands of the Liao River basin; and the North China Plain. Most of those
                features were formed by folding, faulting, or broad zonal subsidence. The mountains are separated by
                alluvial lowlands in areas where recent subsidence has occurred.The mountains of southeastern China
                were formed from Precambrian and Paleozoic remnants of the Yangtze paraplatform by folding and
                faulting that occurred during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The mountain ranges are numerous, are
                of low or moderate elevation, and occupy most of the surface area, leaving only small, irregularly
                shaped plains.The islands off the coast of East Asia and the Kamchatka Peninsula are related
                formations. The Ryukyu Islands, Japan, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands are uplifted fragments of the
                Ryukyu-Korean, Honshu-Sakhalin, and Kuril-Kamchatka mountain-island arcs. Dating from the Mesozoic
                and Cenozoic eras, those arcs have complex knots at their junctions, represented by the topography
                of the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Hokkaido. The mountains are of low or moderate height and are
                formed of folded and faulted blocks; some volcanic mountains and small alluvial lowlands also are to
                be found.Kamchatka is a mountainous peninsula formed from fragments of the Kamchatka-Koryak and
                Kuril-Kamchatka arcs, which occur in parallel ranges. The geologically young folds enclose rigid
                ancient structures. Cenozoic (including contemporary) volcanism is pronounced, and the peninsula has
                numerous geysers and hot springs. Vast plains exist that are composed of alluviums and volcanic
                ashes.</p>

                Central Asia consists of mountains, plateaus, and tablelands formed from fragments of the ancient
                platforms and surrounded by a folded area formed in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. The mountains
                of southern Siberia and Mongolia were formed by renewed uplift of old faulted and folded blocks;
                ranges are separated by intermontane troughs. The Alpine mountains—the Altai, Sayan, and Stanovoy
                mountains—are particularly noticeable. They have clearly defined features resulting from ancient
                glaciation; contemporary glaciers exist in the Altai.The Central Asian plains and tablelands include
                the Junggar Basin, the Takla Makan Desert, the Gobi, and the Ordos Desert. Relief features vary from
                surfaces leveled by erosion in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic to plateaus with low mountains, eroded
                plateaus on which loess had accumulated, and vast sandy deserts covered with wind-borne alluvium and
                lacustrine deposits.Alpine Asia—sometimes known as High Asia—includes the Pamirs and the eastern
                Hindu Kush, the Kunlun Mountains, the Tien Shan, the Gissar and Alay ranges, the Plateau of Tibet,
                the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas. The Pamirs and the eastern Hindu Kush are sharply uplifted
                mountains dissected into ridges and gorges in the west. The Kunlun Mountains, the Tien Shan, and the
                Gissar and Alay ranges belong to an alpine region that was formed from folded structures of
                Paleozoic age. Glaciers are present throughout the region but are most concentrated at the western
                end of the Himalayas and in the Karakoram Range.The Plateau of Tibet represents a fractured alpine
                zone in which Mesozoic and Cenozoic structures that surround an older central mass have experienced
                more recent uplifting. Some of the highlands are covered with sandy and rocky desert; elsewhere in
                that region, alpine highlands are dissected by erosion or are covered with glaciers. The Karakoram
                Range and the Himalayas were uplifted during late Cenozoic times. Their erosion has exposed older
                rocks that were deformed during earlier tectonic events.</p>

                South Asia, in the limited sense of the term, consists of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, peninsular India,
                and Sri Lanka. The Indo-Gangetic Plain is formed from the combined alluvial plains of the Indus,
                Ganges (Ganga), and Brahmaputra rivers, which lie in a deep marginal depression running north of and
                parallel to the main range of the Himalayas. It is an area of subsidence into which thick
                accumulations of earlier marine sediments and later continental deposits have washed down from the
                rising mountains. The sediments provide fertile soil in the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins and in
                irrigated parts of the Indus basin, while the margins of the Indus basin have become sandy deserts.
                Peninsular India and Sri Lanka are formed of platform plateaus and tablelands, including the vast
                Deccan plateau, uplifted in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The region includes tablelands with uplifted
                margins, such as the Western and Eastern Ghats, and terraced and dissected plateaus with lava
                mantles or intrusions.</p>

                Southeast Asia is composed of peninsular Southeast Asia and the islands and peninsulas to the
                southeast of the Asian continent. The mainland consists of the western mountain area and the central
                and eastern mountains and plains. The western mountain area of Myanmar (Burma) is a fold belt of
                Cenozoic age. Mountains of medium elevation constitute folded blocks that decrease in size and
                elevation to the south; the valleys are alluvial and broaden out to the south. Central and eastern
                Thailand and central and southern Vietnam are characterized by mountains of low and moderate height
                that have been moderately fractured. The region is one of Mesozoic structures surrounding the
                ancient mass known as the Kontum block, which comprises plateaus and lowlands filled with
                accumulated alluvial deposits.Archipelagoes border the southeastern margin of Asia, consisting
                mainly of island arcs bordered by deep oceanic trenches. The Indian Ocean arcs—Sumatra, Java, and
                the Lesser Sunda Islands—consist of fragments of Alpine folds that constitute a complex assemblage
                of rock types of different ages. Vigorous Cenozoic volcanic activity, continuing up to the present,
                has formed volcanic mountains, and their steady erosion has filled the adjacent alluvial lowlands
                with sediment.Borneo and the Malay Peninsula are formed from fractured continental land situated at
                the junction of the Alpine-Himalayan and East Asiatic downwarp regions. The mountains are composed
                of folded and faulted blocks; the lowlands are alluvial.The Pacific Ocean island arcs, including
                Celebes (Sulawesi), the Moluccas (Maluku), the Philippine Islands, and Taiwan, have been built by
                ongoing tectonic processes, particularly volcanism. Mountain areas of moderate height, volcanic
                ranges, alluvial lowlands, and coral reef islets are present throughout those regions.</p>

                Middle Asia includes the plains and hills lying between the Caspian Sea to the west and Lake
                Balkhash to the east. That area is composed of flat plains on continental platforms of folded
                Paleozoic and Mesozoic bedrock. Individual uplifted portions form low, rounded hills in the Kazakh
                region, low mountains on the Tupqaraghan and Türkmenbashy (Krasnovodsk) peninsulas of the Caspian
                Sea, and mesas (isolated hills with level summits and steeply sloping sides) in areas of earlier
                marine sedimentation, such as the Ustyurt Plateau and the Karakum Desert. Thick accumulations of
                alluvium have been transported by the wind, forming sandy deserts in the south. Original marine and

                West Asia includes the highlands of Anatolia, the Caucasus, and the Armenian and Iranian
                highlands.The highlands of Anatolia—the Pontic Mountains that parallel the Black Sea, and the Taurus
                and Anatolian tablelands—are areas of severe fragmentation, heightened erosional dissection, and
                isolated occurrences of volcanism. The Greater Caucasus Mountains are a series of upfolded ranges
                generally running northwest to southeast between the Black and Caspian seas. The Armenian Highland
                is a region of discontinuous mountains including the Lesser Caucasus and the Kurt mountains.
                Geologically recent uplifting, in the form of a knot of mountain arcs, took place during a period of
                vigorous volcanism during the Cenozoic. The region is seismically active and is known for its
                destructive earthquakes.The Iranian highlands comprise mountain arcs (the Elburz, the Kopet-Dag, the
                mountains of Khorāsān, the Safīd Range, and the western Hindu Kush in the north; the Zagros, Makrān,
                Soleymān, and Kīrthar mountains in the south), together with the plateaus of the interior and the
                central Iranian, eastern Iranian, and central Afghanistan mountains. There are isolated volcanoes of
                Cenozoic origin, a predominance of accumulated remnants resulting from ancient erosion, and saline
                and sandy deserts in the depressions and stony deserts (hammadas) on the tablelands.</p>

                Southwest Asia, like much of southern Asia, is made up of an ancient platform—the northern fragments
                of Gondwanaland—in which sloping plains occur in the marginal downwarps. Its principal components
                are the Arabian Peninsula and Mesopotamia.The Arabian Peninsula is a tilted platform, highest along
                the Red Sea, on which the stratified plains have undergone erosion under arid conditions. Plateaus
                with uplifted margins, Cenozoic lava plateaus, stratified plains, and cuestas (long, low ridges with
                a steep face on one side and a long, gentle slope on the other) all occur. Ancient marine sands and
                alluvium, resulting from previous subsidence and sedimentation, now take the form of vast sandy
                deserts.Mesopotamia consists of the Tigris and Euphrates floodplains and of the deltas from Baghdad
                to the Persian Gulf. The original lowland is covered with late Cenozoic sedimentation; the elevated
                plain, on the other hand, has been dissected by erosion and denudation under the continental
                conditions prevailing in the late Cenozoic.</p>

                Asia is a land of great rivers. The Ob, Irtysh, Yenisey with the Angara, Lena (with the waters of
                the Aldan and the Vilyuy), Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma rivers all flow northward into the Arctic
                Ocean. Among rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean are the Anadyr, Amur (combined with the Sungari
                [Songhua] and the Ussuri rivers), Huang He (Yellow River), Yangtze (Chang), Xi, Red, Mekong, and
                Chao Phraya.The Salween, Irrawaddy, Brahmaputra, Ganges (Ganga), Godavari, Krishna, and Indus rivers
                flow into
                the Indian Ocean, as does the Shatt al-Arab, which is the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates
                rivers. The Kura and Aras rivers flow into the Caspian Sea. Only small mountain rivers flow from
                Asia into the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea. The Amu Darya (ancient Oxus
                River), Syr Darya (ancient Jaxartes River), Ili (Yili), Tarim, Helmand, and Harīrūd (Tejen) rivers
                empty into vast interior basins. Some of those rivers end in lakes; others end in deltas in the
                sands or salt marshes; and still others flow into oases, where all the water is used to irrigate
                fields or else evaporates.All of the Siberian rivers freeze over in the winter, and some freeze to
                the bottom. In spring widespread flooding occurs as snow fields melt. Those rivers are important
                communication routes, being used by watercraft during the summer and as roads for sleighs and
                snowmobiles in winter; they also teem with fish.In the dry regions where drainage is landlocked,
                many large rivers are temporary ones fed by melting snow and glaciers in the mountains; they reach
                their peak water levels in summer. Rivers in dry regions that are not fed by mountain runoff have
                little water; their levels vary sharply, and periodically or occasionally they dry up completely.
                The rivers of the monsoon climate regions reach their maximum volume in summer and are utilized for
                irrigation. The Asian rivers in the vicinity of the Mediterranean that are not fed by mountain snows
                grow shallow in summer and sometimes even dry up. In the tropical regions, however, the rivers
                perennially are full of water.</p>

                The many lakes of Asia vary considerably in size and origin. The largest of them—the Caspian and
                Aral seas—are the remains of larger seas. The Caspian has been fluctuating in size, and the Aral has
                been shrinking, primarily because its tributaries, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, have been tapped
                heavily for irrigation purposes. Lakes Baikal, Ysyk-Köl, and Hövsgöl (Khubsugul), the Dead Sea, and
                others lie in tectonic depressions. The basins of Lakes Van, Sevan, and Urmia are, furthermore,
                encircled by lava, and Lake Telets was gouged out by ancient glaciation. A number of lakes were
                formed as the result of landslides (Lake Sarez in the Pamirs), karst processes (the lakes of the
                western Taurus, in Turkey), or the formation of lava dams (Lake Jingpo in northeastern China and
                several lakes in the Kuril Islands). In the volcanic regions of the eastern Asian islands, in the
                Philippines, and in the Malay Archipelago, lakes have formed in craters and calderas. The subarctic
                has a particularly large number of lakes; in addition to lakes formed as a result of melting
                permafrost and subsidence, there are also ancient glacial moraine lakes. Many lagoonal lakes occur
                along low coastlines.The lakes in the internal drainage basins—such as Koko Nor, Lake Tuz, and
                others—are usually saline. Lake Balkhash has fresh water in the west and brackish water in the east.
                Lakes through which rivers flow are freshwater and regulate the flow of the rivers that issue from
                them or flow into them; notable examples are Lake Baikal, associated with the Angara River; Lake
                Khanka (the Song’acha and Ussuri rivers); Dongting Lake and Lake Poyang (the Yangtze River); and
                Tonle Sap (the Mekong). Large reservoirs have also been created by constructing hydroelectric
                stations.</p>

                In the Arctic, where glacial and Arctic deserts predominate, the processes of soil building occur
                only in rudimentary form. The soils are skeletal and low in humus. The subarctic north of Asia is
                occupied by a timberless zone of tundra vegetation. The subarctic climate and tundra vegetation give
                rise to specifically tundra-type soils, which are characterized by poor drainage (due to permafrost)
                and only a short period in which it is possible for organic substances to decompose. Those
                conditions result in the accumulation of undecomposed organic residues in the form of particles of
                peat. The poor drainage creates an oxygen-free medium in which a bluish substance known as gley is
                formed. Thus, peaty-gley soils are most characteristic of the tundra. There are widespread
                occurrences of movement by solifluction (or mudflows), heaving of the ground because of frost,
                settling or caving in of the ground from thawing, and formation of stone rings around central areas
                of debris in regions covered with boulders.</p>

                Farther south stretches the transitional belt of the forest tundra, where tundra and sparse forest
                alternate with regularity. Tundra soils alternate with the soils of the taiga (boreal forest), the
                cold, swampy forested region. The soils below the frozen taiga are called cryogenic (influenced by
                frost action). In the mountainous regions the peaty-gley soils are replaced by mountain tundra and
                weakly developed, often embryonic soils of detritus and stony fragments.</p>

                The forest zone occupies the largest part of the temperate zone. Characteristic of soil formation in
                the forest zone is the leaching process. The forest leaves and needles that fall, together with dead
                remains of the sparse grass cover, are subjected to decomposition by organic acids in the litter of
                the forest floor. The duration of the summer season and the amount of precipitation are sufficient
                for complete decomposition of the soluble soil components, and the soil solutions transport them and
                leach them into deeper soil horizons (layers). The undecomposed quartz grains remain in the upper
                horizon, which is therefore infertile; that layer resembles light-gray ashes, which is the reason
                soils of that type are called podzols (Russian: “under ashes”). Different degrees of leaching occur
                in the various subzones of the forest zone. A dense rusty brown horizon of wash-down (deposition in
                an underlying layer of soil) underlies the podzolic portion of the soil profile (or layer); its
                colour is related to the accumulation of iron and aluminum oxides. That layer, called orstein, or
                iron pan, is impervious to water and contributes to the self-swamping of the taiga forests. East of
                the Yenisey River, where permafrost occurs across the entire breadth of the forest zone, soil
                drainage (and consequently the leaching process) is made more difficult, and the typical podzols are
                therefore replaced by specific cryogenic taiga soils. Marshes and bog-type soils are widely
                distributed over a considerable part of the taiga subzones.The deciduous forest subzones of Asia
                form two distinct areas. In western Siberia there are small-leafed (primarily birch or aspen)
                forests on gray forest soils. They are more gray in colour than the podzols because of the greater
                amount of organic substances—such as tree leaves and a more abundant grass cover—feeding those
                soils. That explains their higher humus content, as well as their greater fertility. The second
                section of the deciduous forest subzone has survived in East Asia, stretching from the Xiao Hinggan
                Range in the west to the Japanese island of Honshu in the east; in that subzone abundant warmth and
                moisture intensify chemical weathering, and iron oxides accumulate even in the surface soil
                horizons. In that manner brown forest soils, known as forest burozems, are formed.</p>

                Soil cover in the forest-steppe region is formed when the ratio of precipitation to evaporation is
                in equilibrium and as the leaching process of the wet season alternates with the upward flow of the
                soil solutions during the dry period. Under those conditions, with organic material resulting from
                the dense vegetation abundantly available, humus accumulation in the soil is considerable, and
                dark-coloured soils are formed that are the most fertile in all Asia; known as chernozems, they are
                the thickest of the forest-steppe and mixed-grass soils. Characteristic of the wooded-meadow plains
                of the Amur River basin (the “Amur prairies”) are meadow soils that are dark, moist, and often
                composed of blue gley. In the drier steppes, where vegetation is sparse, the amount of humus is
                reduced and the content of unleached mineral salts is increased; transport of the dissolved salts to
                the surface by the upward flow of soil solutions is also intensified. Associated with that process
                is a bleaching and salinization of the soil. The drier steppes thus form a transitional zone from
                the shallow southern chernozems to the chestnut soils. Broad expanses of the forest-steppe and
                steppe are under cultivation and serve as rich granaries. Severe wind erosion occurs during the hot,
                dry seasons. In many areas surface washout and gully erosion have also impoverished the soil,
                despite preventive efforts</p>

                Through inner Kazakhstan and Mongolia stretches a zone of semidesert, and in Middle Asia, the
                Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin, the Takla Makan Desert, and Inner Mongolia, there is a belt of
                temperate-zone deserts. A belt of subtropical deserts extends through the Levant, the Iranian
                highlands, and the southern edge of Middle Asia. Beneath the semideserts, with their mosaic of
                desert and arid-steppe vegetation, light chestnut and light brown semidesert soils form; those are
                low in humus but contain an abundance of strongly alkaline soil. Beneath the deserts, where the
                supply of organic substances, as well as the humus content, is extremely low, gray-brown soils form
                in the temperate zone, while gray desert soils (sierozems) develop in the arid subtropics. A great
                deal of saline soil is present there, and agriculture is possible only with the use of irrigation,
                which gives rise to specific cultivated types of sierozems.Only in western Asia is the tropical

                Savannas (grassy parklands) and dry-tropical deciduous forests predominate in the rain shadow on the
                leeward slopes of hills, and wet-tropical evergreen forests grow on the rainy windward slopes of
                hills. Intensive leaching followed by evaporation is characteristic of those soils. Under the
                wet-tropical forests, red-yellow laterites (leached and hardened iron-bearing soils) predominate;
                beneath the savannas and dry-tropical forests, there are red lateritic soils that change, with
                increasing aridity, to red-brown and desert brown soils. Beneath the dry savannas of peninsular
                India are unique black soils called regurs that are thought to develop from basalt rock.In the
                equatorial zone (southern Malaysia and the Greater Sunda Islands), typical tropical rainforests have
                developed. In southwestern Sri Lanka and on the Indonesian island of Java, they have been almost
                entirely replaced by an agricultural landscape in which mountain slopes and hills are covered with
                plantations of tea, coconut palms, and rubber trees. The soils are lateritic and are red-yellow or
                brick-red, with marginal degrees of laterization.In the valleys of the subequatorial and equatorial
                zones, alluvial soils predominate; they have been developed by thousands of years of cultivation and
                irrigation of the rice fields. Artificial terracing of the slopes is practiced on a large scale in

                In the mountains zones of different soil types are found at different elevations. As a rule they are
                skeletal, underdeveloped soils, clearly reflecting the differences in rock structure and origin and
                in the degree of exposure of the slopes. The boundaries of the vertical zones become higher from
                north to south, and the number of zones increases. Mountain soils also correspond to the different
                vegetation zones that occur at different elevations.The vertical soil zones correlate with the
                landscape zones as elevation increases. A zone of forest, followed higher up by meadows and with
                snow cover at the highest altitudes, is characteristic of the western maritime regions. On lower
                slopes in the western Caucasus, for example, broad-leaved mountain forests occur on brown
                mountain-forest soils; above those are coniferous forests on mountain podzolic soils, followed by
                stunted trees, followed in turn by subalpine and alpine meadows on mountain-meadow soils, while the
                highest ridges are covered in perennial snow and glaciers. Associations of desert, steppe,
                meadowland, and snow zones are widespread in the interior of Asia and sometimes include
                mountain-forest zones. Characteristic of the Tien Shan, for example, is the predominance of
                mountain-desert and semidesert landscapes, which occur in association with gray-brown and brown
                mountain soils in the foothills of the ranges, while higher up are mountain steppes associated with
                mountain chestnut soils and mountain chernozems. Under parts of the mountain forest-steppe and the
                mountain forests, the soils are podzolized.Typical of the mountains of eastern Siberia are the
                taiga-tundra spectra that occur in vertical zones. Thus, mountain taiga on taiga-cryogenic soils is
                followed by a zone of dwarfed trees, then by mountain tundra, and finally by bald peaks.In eastern
                Asia the subalpine and alpine meadow zones with mountain-meadow soils sometimes disappear; instead,
                mountain-forest landscape extends as far up in elevation as the vicinity of the crests and is
                succeeded only by a zone of stunted trees and shrubs. The spectra of the alpine regions of South
                Asia (notably the Himalayas) are distinguished by the most complex variety of vegetation and soil
                types.</p>

                Virgin soils have been greatly transformed in the areas where agriculture has long been practiced.
                Sometimes primary soils are buried under a thick cultivated layer that is high in humus, nitrogen,
                phosphorus, and trace elements. The irrigated soils of valleys and deltas of the Murgab (Middle
                Asia), the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Indus rivers have a layer of agricultural deposits 10 to 15
                feet (3 to 5 metres) thick. The “black-land” (heitu) soils of the Loess Plateau in China consist of
                a fertile layer 1 to 3 feet (30 to 90 cm) thick of organic material accumulated by local farmers.
                Rice cultivation in the monsoonal regions of Asia has a particular impact on primary-soil cover. The
                upper layer of those so-called “rice soils” is degraded as a result of regular flooding and is
                subject to the gleying process. The basic properties of those soils remain constant for centuries,
                but the soils do not exhibit high fertility.The most harmful and extended phenomenon among the
                effects of irrigation on soil cover in Asia is that of secondary salinization. That process, which
                is a result of improper agricultural practices, is widespread in the soils of the arid, semiarid,
                and subhumid zones of Asia that are irrigated without appropriate drainage. Salt-affected soils
                account for large areas in Central Asia, South Asia, and Southwest Asia.Soil degradation from
                erosion has also hurt agricultural production. The areas of most significant erosion have occurred
                in the Ganges (Ganga) River basin, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, the Huang He basin, and
                the Loess Plateau. Severe soil erosion has resulted from year-round cultivation of the plains and
                from deforestation of water-catchment areas in the mountains.</p>

                landscape zones as elevation increases. A zone of forest, followed higher up by meadows and with
                snow cover at the highest altitudes, is characteristic of the western maritime regions. On lower
                slopes in the western Caucasus, for example, broad-leaved mountain forests occur on brown
                mountain-forest soils; above those are coniferous forests on mountain podzolic soils, followed by
                stunted trees, followed in turn by subalpine and alpine meadows on mountain-meadow soils, while the
                highest ridges are covered in perennial snow and glaciers. Associations of desert, steppe,
                meadowland, and snow zones are widespread in the interior of Asia and sometimes include
                mountain-forest zones. Characteristic of the Tien Shan, for example, is the predominance of
                mountain-desert and semidesert landscapes, which occur in association with gray-brown and brown
                mountain soils in the foothills of the ranges, while higher up are mountain steppes associated with
                mountain chestnut soils and mountain chernozems. Under parts of the mountain forest-steppe and the
                mountain forests, the soils are podzolized.Typical of the mountains of eastern Siberia are the
                taiga-tundra spectra that occur in vertical zones. Thus, mountain taiga on taiga-cryogenic soils is
                followed by a zone of dwarfed trees, then by mountain tundra, and finally by bald peaks.In eastern
                Asia the subalpine and alpine meadow zones with mountain-meadow soils sometimes disappear; instead,
                mountain-forest landscape extends as far up in elevation as the vicinity of the crests and is
                succeeded only by a zone of stunted trees and shrubs. The spectra of the alpine regions of South
                Asia (notably the Himalayas) are distinguished by the most complex variety of vegetation and soil
                types.</p>

                The enormous expanse of Asia and its abundance of mountain barriers and inland depressions have
                resulted in great differences between regions in solar radiation, atmospheric circulation,
                precipitation, and climate as a whole. A continental climate, associated with large landmasses and
                characterized by an extreme annual range of temperature, prevails over a large part of Asia. Air
                reaching Asia from the Atlantic Ocean, after passing over Europe or Africa, has had time to be
                transformed into continental air—i.e., air that has often lost much of the moisture it absorbed over
                the ocean. As a result of the prevalent eastward movement of the air masses in the midlatitudes, as
                well as the isolating effect of the marginal mountain ranges, the influence of sea air from the
                Pacific Ocean extends only to the eastern margins of Asia. From the north, Arctic air has unimpeded
                access into the continent. In the south, tropical and equatorial air masses predominate, but their
                penetration to the centre of Asia is restricted by the ridges of the moutainous belt stretching from
                the highlands of West Asia through the Himalayas to the mountains of southern China and Southeast
                Asia; in the winter months (November through March), such penetration is further impeded by the
                density of the cold air masses over the interior.The contrast between the strong heating of the
                continent in the summer months (May to September) and the chilling in winter produces sharp seasonal
                variations in atmospheric circulation and also enhances the role of local centres of atmospheric
                activity. Winter chilling of the Asian landmass develops a persistent high-pressure winter
                anticyclone over Siberia, Mongolia, and the Plateau of Tibet that is normally centred southwest of
                Lake Baikal. The area affected by the anticyclone is characterized by temperature inversions and by
                very cold, calm weather with little snowfall. The winter anticyclone is fed by subsiding upper air,
                by bursts of Arctic air flowing in from the north, and by the persistent westerly air drift that
                accompanies the gusty cyclonic low-pressure cells operating within the Northern Hemisphere cyclonic
                storm system. The high pressure propels cold, dry air eastward and southward out of the continent,
                affecting eastern and southern Asia during the winter. Only a few of the winter cyclonic lows moving
                eastward out of Europe carry clear across Asia, but they do bring more frequent changes in weather
                in western Siberia than in central Siberia. The zone of lowest temperature—a so-called cold pole—is
                found in the northeast, near Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, where temperatures as low as −90 °F (−68 °C)
                and −96 °F (−71 °C), respectively, have been recorded.The outward drift of winter air creates a
                sharp temperature anomaly in eastern and northeastern Asia, where the climate is colder than the
                characteristic global average for each given latitude. On the East Asian islands, the effect of the
                winter continental monsoon is tempered by the surrounding seas. As the air masses pass over the
                seas, they become warmed and saturated with moisture, which then falls as either snow or rain on the
                northwestern slopes of the island arcs. Occasionally, however, strong bursts of cold air carry cold
                spells as far south as Hong Kong and Manila.</p>

                Cyclonic storms form and move eastward through the zone where the temperate and tropical air masses
                are in contact, called the polar front, which shifts southward in winter. The winter rainy season in
                the southern parts of the West Asian highlands, which is characteristic of the Mediterranean
                climate, is associated with that southward movement of the polar front. In northern areas of West
                and Middle Asia, the effect of cyclonic action is particularly strong in the spring, when the polar
                front moves north and causes the maximum in annual precipitation to occur then.During the northern
                winter, South and Southeast Asia are affected by northeasterly winds that blow from high-pressure
                areas of the North Pacific Ocean to the equatorial low-pressure zone. Those winds are analogous to
                the trade winds and are known in South Asia as the northeast (or winter) monsoon. The weather is dry
                and moderately warm. Rainfall occurs only on the windward side of maritime regions (e.g., Tamil Nadu
                state in southeastern India and southern Vietnam). Some of the cyclonic storms that move eastward
                through the Mediterranean Basin during the winter are deflected south of the Plateau of Tibet,
                crossing northern India and southwestern China. Such storms do not often bring winter rain, but they
                create short periods of cloudy, cool, or gusty weather and are accompanied by snow in the higher
                mountain ranges.In summer the polar front shifts northward, causing cyclonic rains in the mountains
                of Siberia. In West, Middle, and Central Asia, a hot, dry, dusty, continental tropical wind blows at
                that time. Over the basin of the Indus River, the heating creates a low-pressure area. Known as the
                South Asian (or Iranian) low, it appears in April and is fully developed from June to August. The
                onset of monsoon in India and mainland Southeast Asia is related to changes in the circulation
                pattern that occur by June—specifically, the disintegration of the southern jet stream and the
                formation of low pressure over southern Asia. The monsoon air masses flow into that monsoonal
                low-pressure zone from a cell of high pressure just off the eastern coast of southern Africa.
                Because of the Coriolis force (the force caused by the Earth’s rotation), winds south of the Equator
                change direction from southeast to southwest in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The southwest
                monsoon bursts upon the Malabar Coast of southwestern India in early June and gradually extends
                northward over most of the Indian subcontinent and mainland Southeast Asia. It brings considerable
                rainfall, which in most of those areas accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the total annual
                precipitation.In eastern Asia the Pacific Ocean polar front creates atmospheric disturbances during
                the summer. From a summer high-pressure centre over the western Pacific, the warm and moist summer
                monsoon blows from the southeast toward the continent. To the south of latitude 38° N, where the
                warm Kuroshio (Japan Current) approaches the coast of Japan, the summer monsoon brings protracted
                rains and high humidity; together with high temperatures, that creates a hothouse atmosphere.
                Becoming chilled as it passes over cold ocean currents to the north, that air brings fogs and
                drizzling rains to northeastern Asia.</p>

                Summer in China is a time of variable air movement out of the western Pacific. If that drift is
                strong and low pressure over the continental interior is intense, the summer monsoon may carry
                moisture well into Mongolia. If neither the drift nor the continental low is strong, the China
                summer monsoon may fail, falter over eastern China, or cause irregular weather patterns that
                threaten the country with crop failure. The monsoon there is less dramatic than in other areas,
                accounting for 50 to 60 percent of China’s annual rainfall.Tropical cyclones—called typhoons in the
                Pacific Ocean—may occur in coastal and insular South, Southeast, and East Asia throughout the year
                but are most severe during the late summer and early autumn. Those storms are accompanied by strong
                winds and torrential rains so heavy that the maximum precipitation from the typhoons locally may
                exceed the total amounts received during the normal summer monsoons.In winter continental tropical
                air prevails in tropical Asia; in summer it is replaced by equatorial ocean air. The winter season’s
                dry and warm winds, directed offshore toward the equatorial low-pressure axis, are analogous to
                trade winds but simultaneously act as the South Asian continental monsoon. The dry spring that
                follows changes abruptly and dramatically into the rainy summer with the onset of the monsoon. The
                summer monsoon brings enormous amounts of rain (up to about 25 inches [635 mm] in a month). Over the
                areas of Asia closest to the Equator—southern Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the Greater Sunda
                Islands—equatorial air prevails continuously, accompanied by even temperatures and abundant rainfall
                in all seasons. The Lesser Sunda Islands have a tropical monsoon climate; their wet and dry seasons
                are regulated by the calendar rhythm of the Southern Hemisphere, which is characterized by a wet
                summer from November to February and a dry winter from June to October.</p>

                Differences between the climatic conditions of the various regions of Asia are determined to a
                considerable degree by topography. Different elevation-based climatic zones are most clearly defined
                on the southern slopes of the Himalayas, where they vary from the tropical climates of the
                foothills, at the lowest levels, to the extreme Arctic-like conditions of the peaks, at the highest
                elevations. The degree of exposure also plays a large role. The sunny southern slopes differ from
                the shady northern ones, and windward slopes exposed to moist ocean winds differ from leeward
                slopes, which, lying in the wind (and rain) shadow, are necessarily drier. The barrier effect is
                most pronounced in the zone of monsoon circulation (i.e., East, Southeast, and South Asia), where
                rain-bearing winds have a constant direction. In addition to the physical isolation of the leeward
                slopes from the moisture-laden winds, those slopes also experience the foehn effect, in which a
                strong wind traverses a mountain range and is deflected downward as a warm, dry, gusty, erratic
                wind. Contrasts of climate resulting from exposure are manifested clearly in the Himalayas, the
                Elburz Mountains, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, the Tien Shan range, the region to the east of
                Lake Baikal (Transbaikalia), and many other places.The isolating barrier effect of the relief on the
                climate is demonstrated most clearly in the West Asian highlands and in Central Asia. In those
                regions the surrounding mountains isolate the tablelands of the interior from moisture-laden winds.
                The massiveness of the interior highlands is also a significant factor; it gives rise to local
                anticyclones during the cold months of the year.

                The average January temperature over a considerable part of Siberia is below −4 °F (−20 °C), and in
                the region around Verkhoyansk it reaches −58 °F (−50 °C). Near the coast Pacific Ocean air moderates
                the average temperature to from 23 to 5 °F (−5 to −15 °C). The January isotherm (a line connecting
                points of equal temperature) of 32 °F (0 °C) extends eastward from the Anatolian and Iranian
                highlands; skirts the southern edge of the Pamirs, the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas; and runs
                northeastward through China to south of the Shandong Peninsula and through the southern Korean
                peninsula and central Honshu. An isotherm of 68 °F (20 °C) is traced along the Tropic of Cancer and
                one of 77 °F (25 °C) farther south.In July the maximum temperatures are found in the lowlands of
                Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula and in the Thar (Great Indian) and Takla Makan deserts. The 68
                °F (20 °C) isotherm moves as far as latitudes 55° to 60° N, but, in the eastern Gobi and near the
                cool Pacific Ocean, it bends to the south. Along the far northeastern coast of Asia, the average
                temperature in July is below 50 °F (10 °C), which is typical for a tundra climate. The greatest
                amplitude in annual temperature range on Earth occurs near the “cold pole,” which has remarkably
                warm summers; the annual range may exceed 175 °F (97 °C).

                The distribution pattern of precipitation throughout the year is varied. Relatively uniform moisture
                is characteristic of the Asian equatorial zone. Maximum summer precipitation and minimum winter
                precipitation are the rule in the subequatorial zones and in other regions with monsoon climates, as
                well as in those areas where there is summer movement of the fronts—the polar front in the mountains
                of southern Siberia and the Arctic front in the subarctic regions. Wet winters and dry summers are
                typical of the Mediterranean climatic region in West Asia, where precipitation is associated with
                the winter activity of the polar front. That polar-front activity, accompanied by maximum
                precipitation, occurs in the spring in the interior parts of the West Asian highlands. Summer and
                winter precipitation merges in some parts of Asia. In the Kolkhida area of Georgia east of the Black
                Sea, the summer rains—brought by the northwesterly Atlantic air currents—merge with the cyclonic
                Mediterranean winter rains. In some areas of Japan, Korea, and eastern China, there is uniform
                precipitation when, in addition to the summer monsoon, the winter monsoon brings moisture.As the
                aggregate result of those various meteorological patterns, the following types of climate may be
                distinguished in Asia: the tundra climate (associated with the cold, treeless plains of the Arctic
                lowlands of Asia); the cold, sharply continental climate of eastern Siberia; the cold, moderately
                humid western Siberian climate; the humid, subtropical climate associated with the Kolkhida region;
                the desert climate of the temperate zone; the Mediterranean subtropical climate of the western edge
                of West Asia; the subtropical desert climate; the mountain-steppe highland subtropical climate of
                West and Central Asia; the alpine desert climate; the climate of the eastern Pamirs, the Karakoram
                Range, and the Plateau of Tibet; the climate of the tropical deserts; the temperate monsoon climate
                of the East Asian part of Siberia and the northern parts of Japan and eastern China; the subtropical
                monsoon climate of southern Japan and of southeastern China; the subequatorial monsoon climate of
                South Asia, eastern Java, and the Lesser Sunda Islands; and the equatorial climate of the Greater
                Sunda Islands. All the various features of the types of climate mentioned exert a strong influence
                on other natural conditions, as well as on the landscape as a whole.
                Human activities, both cultural and economic, have distinctive effects on climate. One example of
                that is provided by the microclimates associated with cities and with large industrial complexes.
                The emission in those areas of quantities of dust and gases can alter temperatures and change wind
                patterns. Such conditions are characteristic, for example, of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area
                and the industrial region of northern Kyushu in Japan, of Kolkata (Calcutta) and the industrial area
                of the northeastern part of peninsular India, and of the industrial regions of the Kuznetsk Coal
                Basin in south-central Siberia.

                An immense range of vegetation is found in Asia, the result of the continent’s wide diversity of

                The natural landscape has been least affected by people in sparsely populated North Asia. Vast
                plains, continentality, and the nearness of the Arctic Ocean explain the presence there of a zone of
                tundra—cold-tolerant low-lying vegetation in an area of permafrost (permanently frozen
                subsoil)—similar to that found in the European part of Russia and in Canada and the U.S. state of
                Alaska. In more flourishing parts, the tundra has a discontinuous covering of lichens, mosses,
                sedges, rushes, some grasses, cushions of bilberries, and dwarf trees of willow and birch; in the
                far north, lichens grow on favourable hillsides. Because of the greater number of hours of daylight
                during the summer months, when the Arctic Circle region receives the same amount of light energy as
                the tropics, the tundra in that season is covered with bright flowers. Nevertheless, climate
                conditions are extreme. In the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, off the Arctic coast, thawing begins in
                May and frosts begin in August, although in some years frosts may occur at night throughout the
                short summer. The soil never thaws below a depth of 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm); consequently, hollows
                are badly drained and turn into peat bogs. Windy conditions speed evaporation, and the frozen soil
                cannot absorb water to compensate for that action, so surface drought often results in wind erosion
                and the removal of sediments deposited by annual riverine floods.The tundra belt extends still
                farther south on higher ground. In the Arctic, tundra in the Ural Mountains begins at about 3,000
                feet (900 metres), but at latitude 53° N it begins at 4,250 feet (1,300 metres). Tundra extends over
                large areas of the Chersky, Verkhoyansk, and Kamchatka mountain ranges.The taiga (boreal forest)
                zone—a belt of mainly coniferous forest—begins south of the tundra, after a transitional zone of
                “wooded tundra” and forest galleries found along streams between the tundra-covered watersheds.
                Taiga, although essentially coniferous, contains hardy deciduous trees such as aspen and birch;
                there are sections of grass and shrub steppe in the drier zones. Larches account for more than
                one-third of the vast Siberian forest, while pines cover about one-fourth and spruces a tiny
                fraction. The geographic distribution of particular types of vegetation is determined chiefly by
                climate. Spruce, for example, unable to survive temperatures below −36 °F (−38 °C), is not found
                east of the Yenisey River. The taiga has a thin undergrowth of cranberries and bilberries, and there
                are numerous extensive peat bogs.The broad-leaved deciduous forest of western Siberia also does not
                extend east of the Yenisey—where it gives way to the coniferous forests of central Siberia—but it
                reappears in eastern Siberia near the Sea of Okhotsk; poplars, birches, and alders are numerous
                there, as are various conifers and larches. Forests around the Ussuri River include maples, ashes,
                walnuts, elms, and lindens, in addition to species already mentioned.South of the Siberian forests
                are found forest-steppes, with forest galleries lining the rivers. Forest-steppe and meadow-steppe
                vegetation is predominant on the Northeast (Manchurian) Plain. The steppe (grassland) zone runs from
                Kazakhstan in the west through the Altai Mountains to the Da Hinggan (Greater Khingan) Range in the
                east. Herbaceous cover of feather grass, rootstock grasses, and sagebrush is utilized for grazing.
                Farther south discontinuous semidesert and desert vegetation predominates. To the east the steppes
                stretch toward the southern part of the Ordos Plateau, forming the transition to the monsoonal
                landscapes of eastern China.Tibet, which is chiefly dry and cold, has a scattered vegetation of
                halophilic (salt-tolerant) bushes and species of the genus Artemisia.</p>

                The monsoonal climate in East Asia brings hot and rainy summers, giving rise to a great variety of
                temperate and tropical vegetation. China has the most varied vegetation of any country in the world,
                with about 30,000 species, excluding mushrooms and mosses. The enormous variety of plants, which
                includes a large number of relict forest species, is explained by the negligible impact that
                Pleistocene glaciations had on the region’s climate.About two-thirds of Japan’s total area is
                forested, whereas much of China is deforested (roughly one-seventh of China is under forest cover);
                sizable tracts remain untouched, however, in the remote rugged regions of China, and many small
                areas have been reforested. One reason for that difference between the two countries is the
                traditional respect the Japanese have had for their scenery and, consequently, the strict forestry
                regulations that have been promulgated and enforced. In addition, the rugged topography and
                inaccessibility of many of Japan’s forested areas have limited the possibilities for economic
                exploitation. The best examples of East Asian forest, therefore, are found in Japan, such as in the
                Kii Peninsula of Honshu.North of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang), much of China was once covered by
                primeval deciduous forest, most of which has been removed to create farmland. South of the Yangtze,
                the “true” Chinese forest was prevalent before 1800. A wild growth of trees and shrubs survives,
                however, throughout the cultivated areas, and parklike tree growth and stands of bamboo are
                widespread. The original forest cover included 60 different genera of tall trees; among the
                temperate genera were oak, maple, linden, chestnut, hornbeam, and a species of hickory, and among
                the tropical genera were magnolia, the tulip tree, the camphor tree, the Spanish cedar, sweet gum,
                catalpa, and lianas (vines). A variety of conifers of both hemispheres also occurred there, and in
                the mountains of eastern Sichuan there grew a rare and ancient Chinese conifer, the dawn redwood
                (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). Palm trees are found throughout South China and southern South
                Korea, as well as in the southern parts of Japan; many varieties of bamboo also are found in those
                regions.China has been proceeding energetically with a program of reforestation. The new forests,
                however, consisting largely of pines, do not resemble the primeval forests.</p>

                The wettest parts of peninsular India (such as the Western Ghats) and of Southeast Asia have
                magnificent tropical forests noteworthy for the variety of their plant life. A significant feature
                of South Asian vegetation is the family Dipterocarpaceae (yielding aromatic oils and resins), which
                is represented there by more than 500 species. In parts of peninsular India and Southeast Asia that
                have a seasonal monsoon climate (with four to eight dry months per year), moist- and dry-deciduous
                forests thrive. Many of the tree species, such as teak, sal, and sandalwood, are highly valuable and
                are heavily exploited. In areas with a prolonged dry season and less precipitation (e.g.,
                northwestern India, the interior of the Deccan plateau, and the “dry zone” of Myanmar [Burma]),
                savanna woodland and thorny thickets of acacias and euphorbias are the predominant natural
                vegetation. In all of the major climate zones of South and Southeast Asia, and particularly on the
                alluvial plains, much of the natural vegetation has been cleared to make way for
                agriculture.Mangrove swamps thrive in the sheltered muddy coasts and deltas. Their outermost edges
                are represented by species of Rhizophora (red mangrove), followed by those of Bruguiera and
                Avicennia (white mangrove). The bogs on the landward edges of those swamps abound with the
                semiaquatic nipa palm.Primeval evergreen rainforest remains in a few parts of South and Southeast
                Asia. Secondary forest covers a much larger area. The once universally dense forest has given way to
                parklike forest and wooded savanna as a result of intensive grazing, tree harvesting, and shifting
                (slash-and-burn) agricultural practices. Extensive fires in such areas have produced a herbaceous
                landscape, as in the cogonales (areas of coarse tall grasses, used for thatching) of the
                Philippines.Hevea brasiliensis, the rubber tree introduced into tropical Asia from South America in
                the 1870s, is particularly important in plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia.In the higher
                mountains of Southeast Asia, the cooler humid-tropical climate gives rise to deciduous and
                coniferous temperate forest at elevations of between about 4,250 and 10,000 feet (1,300 and 3,000
                metres). Above that level low forests of plants, mostly shrubs of the heath family, are often found.
                Diverse types of trees grow in the mountain forests of the region. The Rakhine (Arakan) Mountains of
                Myanmar, for example, are covered with a thick mantle of little bamboos. In the eastern Himalayas
                sal is intermingled with Castanopsis (a small genus of nut-bearing trees) and pines. Above those are
                found forests of shrubs and trees of the laurel family and, higher still, oaks and conifers; between
                about 10,000 and 13,000 feet (3,000 and 4,000 metres), forests of firs occur. The central Himalayas
                present strikingly beautiful landscapes in the following upward succession: dry sal forest; pine
                forest; cedars, spruces, pines, and oaks; firs, birches, and tall rhododendrons; rhododendron bushes
                and junipers above 13,000 feet (4,000 metres); and perpetual snows above 16,000 feet (4,900 metres).

                In West Asia naturally wild vegetation no longer occurs in clearly defined zones but is dispersed in
                small areas. The region is predominantly arid; desertlike depressions such as the Kyzylkum Desert of
                Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan, and the Rubʿ al-Khali (Empty Quarter)
                of the Arabian Peninsula contrast with the moist, forested mountains that lie between them. Three
                climatic zones, however, characterize West Asia: a continental climate in the northern regions; a
                dry zone, except where northerly winds bring moisture to the mountains, to the south; and a
                Mediterranean climate along the western edges.A few examples of the variety of vegetation associated
                with those climatic zones may be cited. In the Karakum Desert grows a strange xerophytic tree, the
                saxaul, which is oddly shaped, gnarled, and leafless; it is widely used for firewood, and its young
                sprouts make excellent fodder for camels. Between the galleries of saxauls the desert is
                interspersed at wide intervals with bushes and tufts of grass. A fringe of steppe covers the area
                between the Fertile Crescent (which sweeps in an arc from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the
                Mediterranean) and the north and west of the Syrian Desert. With more than 2,000 species of
                plants—more than in the whole of the Sahara—the borders of the Syrian Desert are noteworthy for
                their floral variety. The moist northern slopes of the Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey are
                covered by magnificent forests of beeches and conifers, with an undergrowth of tall cherry laurels,
                hollies, and creepers. That type of forest is also found in Georgia and on the northern slopes of
                the Elburz Mountains in Iran. Along the Mediterranean border of Asia, the natural vegetation is
                similar to that in other parts of the Mediterranean region: holm oak (an evergreen oak), Aleppo pine
                (used in shipbuilding), cistus, mastic tree (which yields mastic, an aromatic resin), and other
                species are found in landscapes of thick underbrush and open scrubland. Extensive forests, with such
                species as the cedar of Lebanon, once grew in that region, but logging and heavy grazing by
                livestock have reduced many once-forested areas to grassland and scrubland.

                Asia’s indigenous vegetation has provided many of the world’s food crops—including most of the
                cereal grains, oilseeds, fruits, and vegetables—and its lands provided one of the great cradles of
                agriculture. Three primary centres for the domestication of those plants have been postulated. One
                was in the southwest, consisting of sites in the Levant and northern Syria, southeastern Anatolia,
                Transcaucasia, and the Zagros Mountains. Wild strains of wheat, barley, certain legumes, cherry and
                peach trees, and grapevines were domesticated in those regions. The second centre was in the south
                and east (northeastern India, peninsular Southeast Asia, the Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and
                southern China), where rice, root crops such as taro and yams, and fruit trees such as bananas and
                mangoes were domesticated. The third centre was in northern China and adjacent regions, where
                foxtail millet, soybeans, and hemp were first cultivated.Asian plant life also has provided building
                materials, such as wood, bamboo, and thatch; ramie and flax for clothing and hemp for rope and
                sacks; bamboo, widely used in the making of utensils; and the bark of the paper mulberry, used in
                the manufacture of bark cloth and paper. In addition, silkworms are fed mulberry leaves; lacquer is
                made from the lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera); and a multitude of other items are obtained from
                plants, including many drugs and pharmaceuticals.</p>

                Agriculture (both rain-fed and irrigated), livestock grazing, and forestry have transformed Asian
                ecosystems. Three areas have undergone the greatest modification by agriculture: the broad band of
                predominantly wheat, corn (maize), and barley cultivation across southern Siberia and northern
                Kazakhstan; a large belt of wheat, corn, millet, and soybean cultivation across northern China; and
                the monsoonal zone of rice cultivation that stretches from India through Southeast Asia and South
                China to the Korean peninsula and Japan. Agricultural landscapes predominate in those regions, and
                natural vegetation is confined to rugged terrain. The impact of human activity in the arid regions
                is intensive in the irrigated areas of Mesopotamia, Middle Asia, the Indus River valley, and
                scattered oases. Pastoral activities have had a major impact on the vast belt of Asian steppes and
                deserts from the Arabian Peninsula to the Gobi and on the scrublands and former woodlands of the
                Asian Mediterranean region.Areas with some of the least-disturbed ecosystems occur in northern and
                eastern Siberia, the Plateau of Tibet, and the mountain ranges of Central Asia. By contrast, areas
                exhibiting some of the most drastic changes to natural conditions include the eastern margins of the
                Thar (Great Indian) Desert in South Asia, Inner Mongolia and the Ordos region in China—all of which
                have been subject to intensive desertification from livestock overgrazing—and the Aral Sea basin in
                Middle Asia. Regarding the latter, large-scale irrigation for cotton cultivation reduced the flow of
                the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which feed the sea, and thus severely reduced its area; a toxic mixture
                of salts and pesticide residue from the dried seafloor has been spread by dust storms throughout the
                region.

                The Himalayas, stretching from east to west, form a barrier that largely prevents the movement of
                fauna southward or northward. Thus, Asia north of the Himalayas, with parts of western Asia and most
                of East Asia, belongs to the Palearctic (Old World) subregion of the Holarctic zoogeographic region
                (roughly, the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics). Asia south of the Himalayas is called the
                Oriental, or Indian, region. The boundary dividing those zones east and west of the Himalayas is not
                well marked, however, as the mountain chains there often have a north-south trend facilitating
                migration of animals between them.Asian faunal habitats have been subjected to the same disruption
                from human activities that has affected the continent’s vegetation, particularly in regions of
                extremely dense population (e.g., the great Indian river valleys and the plains and lowlands of
                eastern and southern China). Asia’s vastness and its numerous remote regions, however, have made it
                possible for many animal species to live practically undisturbed by human activity. Nonetheless, the
                threat of extinction remains for many species, most notably for the giant panda of China and the
                Sumatran rhinoceros and orangutan of Southeast Asia.

                A distinction can be made between the animal life of the tundra in the north and that of the
                adjacent taiga farther south. The taiga in turn merges into the steppes, which have their own
                distinctive forms of animal life. Finally, the faunas of East and Southwest Asia have their own
                distinguishing characteristics.

                Since the tundra subsoil is frozen throughout the year, burrowing animals cannot live there; and, as
                the tundra is partly free from snow only during the short summer, conditions for life are poor. Most
                animals, including reindeer, Arctic hares, Arctic foxes, and wolves, live there in summer only and
                migrate in autumn. Lemmings, however, stay, feeding on the herbage buried beneath the snow. Polar
                bears are occasionally found throughout the year along the coasts of the Arctic and northern Pacific
                oceans, where they feed mainly on seals and fish. Hibernation is impossible, for the short summer
                does not allow enough time for the necessary accumulation of food reserves in the body.Birds are
                numerous during the summer, but they also desert the tundra in winter—except for such birds as
                willow grouse and ptarmigans, which live in tunnels in the snow and feed on berries and leaves. Many
                species of waders, such as gray plovers, the sanderling, and several kinds of sandpipers, migrate to
                the tundra and breed there in the summer, feeding principally on mosquitoes in the wet areas.
                Mosquitoes are also the staple food of passerine birds (true perching birds), such as the snow
                bunting and the Lapland bunting. Gyrfalcons (large Arctic falcons), rough-legged buzzards, and skuas
                (large dark-coloured rapacious birds of northern seas) prey on those smaller birds and on lemmings.
                Several kinds of geese and ducks, the Arctic tern, and species of divers occupy the moist parts.

                The taiga fauna is much richer than that of the tundra. The taiga is the haunt of brown bears,
                wolves and foxes, gluttons (a kind of wolverine), otters, ermines, sables, lynx, elk, forest
                reindeer, hares, and several kinds of squirrels. Birds include species of grouse and woodpeckers and
                pine grosbeaks, crossbills, siskins, redpolls, red-spotted bluethroats, rubythroats, redwings,
                fieldfares (medium-sized thrushes), nutcrackers, and Siberian jays. Wading birds include terek
                sandpipers, which frequent marshes and pools.The rivers of North Asia are inhabited by many common
                freshwater fishes and by several kinds of sturgeons, including sterlets. Lake Baikal has a unique
                aquatic life, including many endemic species of sponges, worms, and crustaceans and the Baikal seal
                (Phoca sibirica).

                The animal life of the steppes differs as much from that of the taiga as from that of the tundra. It
                includes many burrowing rodents, such as jerboas, marmots, and pikas, and larger mammals, such as
                numerous antelope. The steppes were the original home of the northern cattle (Bos taurus), the
                horse, and probably the Bactrian (two-humped) camel; few, if any, of those remain as truly wild
                animals. Typical birds are bustards, quails, sand grouse, and the red-legged hobby. Hoopoes and
                rollers are common locally, and bee-eaters and the common sand martin nest along riverbanks.
                Waterfowl inhabit the reed beds of the great rivers, as do locusts, which periodically migrate in
                immense swarms, devastating crops.Wild sheep and goats live in the mountains and on the plateau
                regions to the north of the Himalayas. Tibet is the home of the wild yak, which is in great danger
                of extinction, although the domesticated yak survives.

                The eastern part of the region—consisting of northeastern and eastern China, the Korean peninsula,
                and Japan—has several endemic varieties of deer. The Siberian tiger, originally native to
                southeastern Siberia, northeastern China, and Korea, now survives only in a small region along the
                border between Russia and China. The endangered giant panda inhabits the mountain forests of
                south-central China; the lesser, or red, panda—the giant panda’s only close relative—is a much
                smaller Himalayan mammal. Some species of animals are endemic to Japan, including a monkey related
                to the tailless Barbary macaque of Gibraltar.The large rivers of China have a rich fish life, among
                which a species of paddlefish (Psephurus gladius) from the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) and Huang He
                (Yellow River) is of interest, as it is one of the two survivors of an otherwise extinct family, the
                other remnant of which is the paddlefish of North America. Another freshwater animal is the giant
                salamander, found in Japanese waters. Southeast Asia and southern China are the home of most members
                of the carp family, from which the various forms of goldfish are derived.The animal life of Anatolia
                is much like that of the rest of the Mediterranean region, but that of Israel, Syria, and Arabia
                also includes an African element, such as a species of hyrax and—in Lake Tiberias (the Sea of
                Galilee) and the Jordan River—fish of the African genus Tilapia, including the Nile perch. The
                donkey may have been domesticated in Southwest Asia, and the dromedary (one-humped) camel was
                originally native to the drier portions of Middle Asia.

                The greater part of the Oriental region is tropical. The northwestern part is dry and partly desert,
                so animal life is chiefly confined to the forms related to those of the dry parts of the Ethiopian
                and Palearctic regions. Elsewhere, monkeys are common. Apes are found only in tropical rainforests;
                gibbons inhabit regions of Assam (in northeastern India), Myanmar, peninsular Southeast Asia, and
                the Greater Sunda Islands, while orangutans are restricted to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo,
                where they are in danger of extinction.The Asiatic distribution of the African lion is now confined
                to Gir Forest National Park of the Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat state, India, where it is
                protected, but a few specimens may still occur in southeastern Iran. Tigers are now found from the
                Himalayas to Sumatra, though their range was once much wider. Leopards range throughout the region,
                except in Sumatra. Civets and mongooses are numerous. The badgerlike ratel lives in the hilly
                districts of peninsular India and is even to be seen as far west as Israel. Jackals are plentiful in
                India; the striped hyena is confined to drier parts. Both are absent from the east.Flying and
                ordinary squirrels are common in woodlands. Gaurs (large wild oxen) are found in India and Myanmar,
                and bantengs (Malayan wild oxen) are distributed in Myanmar and south to Borneo and Java but not in
                Sumatra.The most common antelope is the blackbuck, found in open brush-covered wild areas and
                cultivated plains throughout India, except on the Malabar Coast of India; the nilgai, or blue bull,
                and the chousingha (a four-horned antelope of northern India) occupy hilly regions south of the
                Himalayas. Species of deer include musk deer in the pine zone of the Kashmir region, Nepal, and the
                Indian state of Sikkim; sambar deer practically over the whole region; and muntjac (barking deer)
                ranging northward into southernmost China.Chevrotains (small hornless deerlike ruminants) are
                typical, and wild pigs are also widely distributed. Indian one-horned rhinoceroses are protected and
                confined to Nepal and Assam; Sumatran two-horned rhinoceroses are now restricted to the deep forests
                of Malaysia, southern Sumatra, and northern Borneo; the one-horned Javan rhinoceros population
                numbers only a few dozen. Malayan tapirs live in dense forests in southern Myanmar, Malaysia, and
                Sumatra. Indian elephants are found throughout the region. Scaly anteaters, or pangolins—also found
                in Africa—are characteristic. The tropical breed of cattle (Bos indicus), known as the Brahman or
                zebu and recognizable by its shoulder humps, was domesticated in India, as was the water buffalo,
                which is now distributed from Egypt to central China and the Philippines.</p>

                Game birds are important. The Indian peacock can be seen throughout India, whereas another species
                of peacock (Pavo muticus) is restricted to Java. Numerous species of pheasants live in the forests
                of Myanmar, Thailand, peninsular Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo. Jungle fowl are
                unique to the Oriental region and are the source of all domesticated chickens. Pigeons occur in
                great variety, but the number of species of parrots is small compared with other tropical
                regions.Water and wood kingfishers are represented by many species. Hornbills show their greatest
                development in the Oriental region. The Indian hoopoe is common in India but is only a migratory
                bird in the southeastern part of the region. Among cuckoos the brain-fever bird—an Asian hawk cuckoo
                that takes its name from the suggested effect of its repetitious cry—is well known. Eagles, osprey,
                falcons, hawks, kites, and buzzards all occur; in the western part vultures are numerous and are
                found even in towns.The forests are inhabited by many species of woodpeckers. The barbets
                (loud-voiced tropical birds) are characteristic, the best known being the coppersmith bird.
                Bee-eaters and rollers are common in India, but, whereas the former can be found as far as the Malay
                Archipelago and beyond, rollers are absent in the southeast except in Celebes and beyond. The
                passerine birds are numerous. The house crow, the Indian grackle, and the common mynah are familiar
                birds in India. Drongos (Old World passerines, usually black with hooked bills), flycatchers,
                bulbuls, tailorbirds, orioles, and many others are widely distributed, and broadbills are typical.
                Among the herons the white cattle egret is common throughout the region, whereas spoonbills, cranes,
                and gulls are mostly confined to the western part.

                wider distribution. Freshwater turtles and land tortoises are well represented. Lizards are
                numerous, and flying lizards are also typical of the region. Chameleons are chiefly African, but one
                species is found in peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Snakes are numerous, among them the poisonous
                krait, cobra, and Russell’s viper. Frogs and toads are abundant.

                The freshwater fish life of the Oriental region is rich. The carp and catfish families have many
                native genera and species. The labyrinth fish (so named for a labyrinthine outpocketing of the gill
                chamber that permits them to take oxygen from air as well as from water), to which the climbing
                perch and the gourami belong, are characteristic of the fish life of the region, as are spiny eels.

                Fossil evidence indicates that Asia has been under occupation by human species for at least one
                million years and most likely longer. The first humans in Asia may have descended from groups of the
                extinct species Homo erectus that migrated to the continent from Africa. There is much debate as to
                whether modern Asian peoples evolved from those early humans or represent the descendants of
                anatomically modern peoples who migrated out of Africa beginning about 100,000 years ago.A
                discussion of Asian peoples and their cultural development cannot entirely exclude other parts of
                the Old World. The relatively recent, Western conceptual division of the Eurasian landmass into
                “Europe” and “Asia” has only minor significance in relation to the historic patterns of human
                occupation of the continent. The cultural diversity of Asia is greater than that of any other
                continent, because it represents ethnic types and linguistic systems that have evolved over long
                periods of time in separated regional homelands with distinct physical environments, as well as
                repeated patterns of modification and intermixture that have resulted from both peaceful and
                militant migrations. Some Asian territories have become highly diversified ethnic and linguistic
                mosaics in which there are mixed and overlapping elements.

                style="padding-right: 12px;  text-align:center; position:relative; left:2px; bottom:280px; margin:0px;">
                The two primary prehistoric centres from which migrations of modern human populations over the
                continent took place were Southwest Asia and a region comprising the Mongolian plateaus and North
                China.From prehistoric to historic times, possibly beginning as early as 60,000 years ago, movements
                from Southwest Asia continued toward Europe and into Central Asia (including Middle Asia) and East
                Asia; significant movements into India and Southeast Asia also took place. There were probably small
                divergent migrational movements in other directions that became swallowed up in later patterns of
                mixing.Important Asiatic migrations, however, also originated in Central Eurasia. Such movements
                must have begun as early as 10,000 years ago, but probably the most significant of those migrations
                for the present ethnic and linguistic makeup of the continent were those of the
                Indo-European-speaking peoples, beginning about 3000 BCE. Those peoples migrated both west into
                Europe and south and southeast into Southwest and South Asia. People who spoke a language ancestral
                to the modern Indo-Aryan languages began arriving in northern India about 2000 BCE. Other people
                speaking an early Iranian language probably spread into Iran about the same time. Migrations out of
                Central Asia continued into the early centuries CE as Mongols pushed westward Turkic peoples, who
                occupied large parts of western Central and Southwest Asia. The westward Asiatic movements also
                produced, over a period of time, much mixing of early European and Asiatic peoples in Central and
                West Asia. Northern Asia continued to be inhabited chiefly by thinly distributed residual elements
                of ancient eastern Asian peoples, although some fairly late northward movements of Turkic peoples
                did take place. In addition, prehistoric countermovements along the China coast may have carried
                early Asiatic migrants from South China and Southeast Asia northward into southern Korea and Japan;
                in the latter those peoples mixed with and gradually supplanted the indigenous Ainu, who were of
                uncertain origin.Within the broad zone of Central Asia, recurrent movements retracing older
                migratory routes have created overlapping and fragmented ethnic groups. Secondary and tertiary
                intermixing of many of those regionally derived groupings has resulted in still more complex
                patterns of ethnic identity and distribution. Thus, the original speakers of Uzbek, a Turkic
                language, were probably people from eastern Central Asia similar in appearance to Mongolians; some
                of them migrated westward to near the Volga River at an early date, then moved southward to become
                intermixed with peoples who probably spoke Iranian languages and looked much like modern Iranians.
                Uzbeks are now widely distributed in Central Asia.An ancient migration similar in impact to that of
                the speakers of Indo-European languages in West Asia was that of the Austronesian speakers in
                Southeast Asia. Both linguistic and archaeological evidence suggest that the first Austronesian
                languages may have been spoken on the island of Taiwan about 4000 BCE. Some Austronesian speakers
                traveled south and west to settle Indonesia, the Malay Peninsula, and parts of peninsular Southeast
                Asia, where they may have mixed with preexisting populations; from Indonesia, Austronesian speakers
                later colonized Madagascar, off the coast of Africa. Others spread first south and then east along
                the coasts of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, probably mixing with earlier inhabitants.
                From there, speakers of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian—which includes the Polynesian
                languages, most of the languages of Micronesia, and many languages of Melanesia—spread to nearly all
                of the islands of the Pacific Ocean, including distant Hawaii and Easter Island. Today, Austronesian
                languages are spoken throughout insular Southeast Asia and beyond.Another major series of
                prehistoric and early historic migrations originating in what is now southern China involved the
                ancestors of many of the present-day inhabitants of mainland Southeast Asia. As Chinese civilization
                and Chinese-speaking people expanded southward from their original homeland in northern China
                beginning during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) and increasingly from the Qin and Han dynasties
                (221 BCE–220 CE) up to modern times, the original inhabitants of southern China, speaking languages
                in the Tibeto-Burman, Tai, and Hmong-Mien (Miao-Yao) families, either merged with the
                Chinese-speaking population or migrated southward or into upland enclaves in southern China. Those
                who migrated to the south were among the ancestors of the Burmans, the Lao, the Thai, and Southeast
                Asian minorities such as the Hmong, the Shan, and the Karen.There have been many small-scale
                movements apart from the main trends, and those have complicated the ethnic picture of particular
                regions. For example, there is general agreement among scholars that a nomadic ethnic group began
                moving out of India no later than about 1000 CE and probably several centuries earlier and became
                the ancestors of the contemporary European Roma. A great variety of peoples also settled in the
                Caucasus region, including speakers of Iranian and other Indo-European languages, speakers of
                languages in at least two language families found only in the Caucasus, and speakers of Turkic
                languages.</p>

                Within historic time the aggressive expansion of particular ethnic groups has either driven weaker
                groups away from their territory or resulted in the newcomers’ assuming control of the territory and
                reducing the older inhabitants to the status of ethnic minorities. Some of those weaker ethnic
                groups eventually have lost their identity through intermixture. In some instances a new ethnic
                group with its own dialect has resulted from the mixing. Some areas now consist of multiple enclaves
                of distinct ethnic groups, each following its own way of life. In parts of Southeast Asia, for
                example, ethnic distinctions correspond to topography, with larger groups dominating state societies
                based in the coastal and riverine lowlands and minority groups with a smaller-scale tribal or
                clan-based organization occupying the interior uplands. Within what are now India and Pakistan the
                migration of Indo-Aryan speakers eastward and southward produced discontinuous patterns of
                ethnicity.Militant campaigns of Arabs spread Islam and Arab political structures out of Arabia
                westward into Africa and Spain, northward through the Levant into Anatolia, and eastward into
                Central Asia, Persia, India, and the Malay Archipelago. Beginning in the 7th century CE and lasting
                until the 16th century, those efforts brought a substantial Arab migration to Southwest Asia.During
                the period of European imperialism, the penetration by Russians into North and Central Asia and by
                western Europeans into the oceanic fringes of South and East Asia carried those peoples to all parts
                of the Eurasian continent. The expansion of commerce after the arrival of Europeans gave further
                impetus to a preexisting stream of migration from coastal China to Southeast Asia. The British also
                encouraged migration from the Indian subcontinent to Malaysia and Singapore. Since the 17th century
                the resultant intermixing of peoples has produced new ethnic identities, including the Anglo-Indians
                of India and the Burghers of Sri Lanka. Intermarriage between Chinese immigrant men and local women
                has produced many people of mixed origin in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. The
                introduction of American soldiers of European and African American ancestry to East and Southeast
                Asia during and after World War II has further complicated the ethnic mosaic in China, South Korea,
                Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The modern mixings of peoples were once considered a new
                phenomenon but are increasingly being viewed as a continuation of historical patterns of migration
                and cultural diffusion.

                The development of modern forms of political administration among Asian states has produced some
                distinctive regional patterns. The Soviet Union was the first state to organize administrative
                districts on an ethnolinguistic basis; some 100 separate ethnic groups were officially recognized
                during the Soviet period, with about 60 occupying ethnic territories with administrative status at
                major or minor levels. The larger units, such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, became separate
                republics with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, while others have retained some degree of
                autonomy within Russia. China under the communist regime adopted a similar system and modified the
                imperial political structure in regions containing ethnic or linguistic minorities—primarily in
                southern and southwestern China, northwestern China, and Central Asia. Ethnic territorialism was
                relatively fixed and stable in the Soviet Union; but in China changes have occurred in the
                boundaries of its autonomous regions, and not all minorities have been granted internal territorial
                autonomy.In India, where hundreds of languages are spoken and many ethnic groups coexist,
                ethnolinguistic recognition occurs only at the state level. The boundaries of many Indian states now
                roughly follow linguistic limits. Many minorities have not been given territories of their own, and
                the question of ethnic and linguistic territorial autonomy has given rise to considerable unrest
                within India. In both India and Pakistan, the tribal and frontier agencies formed during British
                rule have become full states on the basis of their cultural unity.Myanmar (Burma) attempted with
                limited success to resolve the problems of integrating ethnic minorities into a modern political
                structure after several upland ethnic minority groups militantly opposed forms of limited
                territorial autonomy offered by the government. Throughout most of the countries of Southeast Asia,
                ethnic minorities have been slow to receive formal recognition, although many governments now have
                developed policies for incorporating minorities into the national life.Malaysia is a multiethnic
                state in which Malays constitute roughly half the total population and Chinese about one-fourth,
                with Indians and tribal minorities making up the remainder. The Malaysian constitution does not
                recognize the country’s pluralistic composition: Malay is the official language, with English also
                being recognized officially; Islam is a state religion (although religious freedom is guaranteed);
                and the head of state must be a Malay. Political parties, however, often represent ethnic groupings,
                and there are—in practice—many ways in which all ethnic elements are represented.In most states of
                Southwest Asia, ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities exist without formal recognition of
                their status. Lebanon, for example, is ethnically and linguistically Arab, but a significant
                proportion of its people are Christian and its Muslim population is divided between Sunnites and
                Shīʿites. Israel has a sizable Arab minority, and Iran is only about half Persian in ethnic and
                linguistic terms. In the Arab-majority states of the Persian Gulf, there are substantial populations
                of migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia, as well as significant minorities of Shīʿite
                Muslims.

                The languages of Asia are richly diverse. The vast majority of the people of continental Asia speak
                a language in one of three large language families. The first, Altaic, consists of the Turkic,
                Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (Tungusic) subfamilies. The second, Sino-Tibetan, includes the Chinese
                and Tibeto-Burman languages. Finally, the Indo-European family consists of the Indo-Aryan, Iranian,
                and Slavic languages, as well as Armenian.The peoples of peninsular and insular Asia, however, speak
                numerous other languages, including those in the Austroasiatic, Tai, Hmong-Mien (Miao-Yao), and
                Dravidian families, as well as Japanese, Korean, a vast number of Austronesian languages, and the
                unrelated languages lumped together within the Paleo-Siberian areal category. Also spoken on the
                western bounds of Asia are Arabic and Hebrew (both Afro-Asiatic languages) and the Caucasian
                languages, consisting of at least two unrelated families. Except for the extensive eastward
                expansion of Russian (a Slavic language), the pattern of language distribution in Asia has remained
                relatively stable since the 18th century.However, many of the languages spoken by ethnic groups
                numbering a few thousand or less have become functionally extinct and exist today, if at all, only
                in the records of linguists. Those fragile groups cannot long withstand the onslaught of more
                politically and economically influential languages that often are imposed along with new cultural
                patterns.Among the dominant languages that have gained speakers is Russian, which remains the
                primary public language in Siberia and is still important in the Central Asian republics, having
                been taught to large numbers of non-Slavic inhabitants. Similarly, Mandarin Chinese—now generally
                called putonghua (“common language”) in China—is spoken by more people than any other language in
                the world, although such regional languages as Wu and Cantonese also retain their vitality.In India,
                where more than 20 languages are officially recognized, the larger regional languages are not losing
                ground, despite enormous increases in the Hindi-speaking population. The major languages of northern
                India, including Hindi, evolved from Sanskrit and are members of the Indo-European language family,
                while the languages of southern India belong to the Dravidian family and include Tamil and Telugu.
                More than 10 different scripts are used in India. An Indian banknote has its value written on it in
                13 Indian languages and also in English. Hindi and English are the official languages of the Indian
                central government. The dominance of Hindi has become a political issue in parts of India where it
                is not the primary language, particularly in the Dravidian-speaking south.The island nations of
                Southeast Asia, each with hundreds of local languages, have adopted national languages to facilitate
                communication. Indonesia’s official national language is Bahasa Indonesia, but hundreds of local
                languages and dialects remain in use across the vast archipelago. Javanese, for example, has more
                than twice as many native speakers as Bahasa Indonesia. The Philippines, which also has hundreds of
                local languages and dialects, has adopted Pilipino (or Filipino, a standardized form of Tagalog) as
                a national language, although it is the first language of only about one-fourth of the population.
                English—the language of administration when the Philippines was a U.S. possession—remains in wide
                use; both English and Pilipino are official languages.Factors such as ethnic migration, extended
                commerce, and political flux continue to complicate language patterns in many parts of Asia. Around
                the old Central Asian oases and in southern Siberia, migrants from Russia and exiled ethnic groups
                have created ethnically and linguistically mixed regional populations. As European Russians moved
                into the new cities in Central Asia and western Siberia, Russian became the language of the cities;
                the older languages have been confined chiefly to the countryside. In other areas, the economic
                attraction of the cities, both for foreigners and for the rural poor, has created urban linguistic
                patterns of increasing complexity.

                Hinduism, with a polytheistic and ritual tradition comprising numerous cults and sects, is the
                oldest of several religions that originated in South Asia. It remains a unifying force of Indian
                culture and the social caste system—which Hindu tradition sees as a reflection of the relative
                spiritual purity of reincarnated souls. The religion has had little appeal outside the Indian
                cultural context. Except on Bali and other “Hinduized” islands of Indonesia, Hinduism is practiced
                outside the subcontinent mainly by Indian expatriates.Jainism and Buddhism emerged in reaction to
                prevailing Hindu practices in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, respectively. Although Jainism never
                spread significantly beyond two present-day states of northwestern India, its principles of
                nonviolence and asceticism have deeply influenced Indian thought.Buddhism arose in northeastern
                India as a “universal” alternative to hierarchical religion, offering nirvana, or enlightenment, to
                individuals regardless of culture or social station. In the centuries following its foundation,
                Buddhism gave rise to two main divergent schools: Theravada, which claimed orthodox adherence to the
                teachings of the religion’s founder, the Buddha, and Mahayana, which held its teachings to be the
                fullest account of the Buddha’s message. The monastically oriented Theravada predominates today in
                Sri Lanka and mainland Southeast Asia, while the more liberal Mahayana, with its proliferation of
                philosophical schools and sects, has had an immeasurable impact on the civilizations of China,
                Korea, and Japan. Vajrayana, or Tantrism, is an esoteric form of Buddhism practiced in the Tibet
                Autonomous Region of China, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia. In India itself, the once sizable Buddhist
                population has diminished to a relatively small number of adherents.Sikhism, a monotheistic Indian
                religion, was founded in the Punjab in the late 15th century CE and has fueled that region’s modern
                demands for independence. The current Indian state of Punjab has a Sikh majority, with the city of
                Amritsar in that state as the religion’s spiritual centre.</p>

                Southwest Asia (the Middle East) is the cradle of three great monotheistic systems: Judaism and its
                offshoots Christianity and Islam. Judaism, founded in the eastern Mediterranean region some 4,000
                years ago, posits a covenant relationship between God—the source of divine law—and humankind. Most
                Asian Jews now live in Israel, although there are small Jewish communities in various other areas of
                the continent. In the 20th century a number of Jewish sects and reform movements founded elsewhere
                accompanied immigrants to Israel.Christianity, which was derived from Judaism some two millennia
                ago, came to have the largest number of believers among the world’s religions. After it was adopted
                by the Roman and Byzantine empires, Christianity became predominant in Europe and in
                European-derived cultures. It is practiced by sizable minorities in many Asian countries (notably
                South Korea) and by Roman Catholic majorities in East Timor and the Philippines.Islam dominates as
                the state religion of most Southwest Asian countries, and a substantial majority of Muslims live in
                Asia. From the Arabian Peninsula, where it was founded in the 7th century, Islam spread throughout
                the Middle East, into Central Asia and parts of South Asia, and across the Bay of Bengal to Malaysia
                and to Indonesia, which remains predominantly Muslim. The majority of Asian Muslims belong to the
                orthodox Sunni branch, except in Iran and Iraq, where members of the more esoteric Shiʿi branch are
                in the majority. Muslims constitute important minority populations in India, the Philippines, and
                China. Among the other religions that developed in Southwest Asia are Zoroastrianism, an ancient
                religion that survives in Iran and India and contains both monotheistic and dualistic elements; and
                Bahāʾī, a universalist faith founded in Persia (Iran) in the mid-19th century.</p>

                Ancient Chinese religious and philosophical traditions survive in the form of two main schools,
                Daoism (Taoism) and Confucianism, both of which originated in the 5th or 6th century BCE. The two
                schools differ in orientation—Daoism stressing mystical experience and the individual’s harmony with
                nature and Confucianism emphasizing the duty of the individual in society and government—but both
                have profoundly influenced Chinese and Chinese-derived culture. Indigenous Chinese folk religious
                traditions continue to influence the practice of both Daoism and Confucianism, as well as Buddhism,
                which has many adherents in China. Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism are also widespread in Korea,
                where indigenous Korean religious traditions remain important as well.Shintō encompasses the
                indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Japanese people. Although among some practitioners
                that tradition has absorbed the influences of other belief systems, such as Confucianism, Daoism,
                and Buddhism, its fundamental principles linking sacred power, ritual observance, and imperial
                nationhood remain unique to Japanese culture.</p>

                Agriculture remains the mainstay of Asia, though the proportion of the population engaged in
                agriculture is steadily declining. Although marginal lands in many parts of South and East Asia have
                been brought under cultivation, and many former pastoral ranges in Southwest and Central Asia are
                now irrigated, the broad ecological factors touched upon above have continued to give rise to
                geographic variations in population and economic activity. Parts of South and East Asia can support
                dense populations. Moister regions in the southwest—for example, in Turkey and northern Iran—support
                large populations. In Southwest and Central Asia in general, however, agricultural productivity and
                population density vary markedly with the regional pattern of precipitation or the availability of
                water from humid highlands nearby. In the Central Asian republics the older pastoral nomadism has
                been transformed into organized transhumance (i.e., the seasonal migration of stock between lowlands
                and mountains); consequently, the families that were formerly nomadic have become permanent
                residents in villages, and only herders accompany the flocks and herds. Northern Asia remains a
                semideveloped frontier region with short-season crops growing in favoured southern localities, even
                though breeding of newer varieties has extended agriculture northward. The Arctic fringe is being
                developed on the basis of mineral resource exploitation, but only in particular localities. Siberia
                has remained lightly populated, with the population concentrated in scattered local centres. The
                agriculturally productive river plains of South Asia, China, and Southeast Asia have supported dense
                rural populations and large cities since the beginnings of civilization. Irrigated agriculture has
                provided the surplus to sustain urban elites.</p>

                Population densities have everywhere increased, and the modernization of agriculture, increased
                mineral exploitation, and industrialization have brought cultural change. Some of the small ethnic
                groups have been dying out, but larger groups often have accepted change and have increased in
                numbers. In South and East Asia, growing lowland populations have been pressing hard on the
                available land as population densities exceed 2,000 persons per square mile (750 per square km). In
                Indonesia, government programs have encouraged farmers to relocate from Java, one of the most
                densely populated places on Earth, to more thinly populated Indonesian islands, where ethnic
                Javanese have sometimes come into conflict with indigenous peoples.Similarly, in Central Asia, both
                Chinese and Russian settlement programs have moved peoples from heavily populated regions into
                frontier zones in order to develop both agricultural and industrial resources. In southern Siberia
                the Soviet settlement program spread a thick wedge of European Russians and assorted ethnic
                minorities eastward to the Pacific Ocean and northward along every river valley to the Arctic Ocean.
                As a result, many of the Paleo-Siberian ethnic groups have been submerged and absorbed. Old trading
                posts, oasis towns, and the few old cities of southern Siberia and the Central Asian republics have
                been developed into modern industrial centres; those locations have been linked to modern transport
                systems by which raw materials and manufactured products flow to the European regions. Most new
                cities have been populated largely by European Russians, with Asian peoples remaining chiefly in the
                rural areas. The modernization of Southwest Asia—through the renaissance of Turkey and the impact of
                petroleum exploitation on the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, and Iran—has altered many of the old patterns
                of ethnic groupings in those areas. A further alteration of the historic pattern came in 1948 with
                the creation of the State of Israel, to which large numbers of Jews from North Africa, the Middle
                East, Europe, and North America have migrated.</p>

                More than two-fifths of all Asians live in and around cities and towns, and increasing urbanization
                is heightening regional contrasts in population density. Israel, Japan, and Singapore are among the
                most highly urbanized countries in the world, and Asia claims several of the world’s largest
                metropolises. Two basic factors account for that concentration: natural population growth in the
                cities themselves and large-scale rural-to-urban migration. In many cities, such as Kolkata
                (Calcutta), Mumbai (Bombay), Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, and even Shanghai, the ceaseless influx
                overwhelms the existing capacity to provide jobs, services, and appropriate shelter for new
                arrivals. The results are squatter settlements and shantytowns that may contain as many as half of
                the city’s people. Such areas typically lack proper water supply, electricity, sanitation, and
                transportation facilities, although over time the quality of the makeshift dwellings often
                improves.A distinctive adaptation on a large scale, called the extended metropolis, is emerging in
                some areas. In such a development, the expanding peripheries of the great cities merge with the
                surrounding countryside and villages, where a highly commercialized and intensive form of
                agriculture continues yet where an increasing portion of the farmers’ income is derived from nonfarm
                work. Some decentralization of urban industry occurs, and many new industrial and service jobs
                become available for the rural population. Movement of goods and people is extensive, if basic,
                achieved with bicycles, mopeds, carts, trucks, buses, and trains. The quasi-rural environs of urban
                centres offer to investors and residents alike advantages such as lower land costs, better labour
                markets, and less congestion and environmental pollution than exist in the cities proper. The
                extended metropolis model is thus an alternative form of urban growth that helps to divert what
                might otherwise be an overwhelming flood of migrants to the great cities. Beijing-Tianjin,
                Shanghai-Nanjing, Hong Kong–Guangzhou, Delhi–New Delhi, Mumbai-Pune, and Seoul are examples of a
                form of growth that can lead eventually to the kind of megalopolitan development found in the
                Tokyo-Yokohama–Ōsaka-Kōbe corridor of Japan.</p>

                About 1750 it would have been relatively easy to describe the population and ethnic distribution of
                Asia. The whole of northern Eurasia was rather lightly populated by diverse Paleo-Siberian,
                Tungusic, and Turkic peoples who engaged in hunting, foraging, fishing, or herding. Some groups,
                such as the Nenets, Sakha, and Chukchi, had somewhat distinctive economies focused on a single
                activity or on activities that changed seasonally.Central Asia, Tibet, and Mongolia formed a mixed
                zone dominated by nomadic pastoralists such as the Buryat Mongols and the Kyrgyz, while the lower
                plateaus and river valleys were sprinkled with agricultural districts settled by the Tajiks,
                Uighurs, Uzbeks, and other groups. Population density was relatively light; mountain regions were
                occupied only in summer, but there were locally concentrated populations centred on such large oases
                as Tashkent, Samarkand, Kashi (Kashgar), and Ürümqi (Urumchi), with smaller groupings around lesser
                sources of water. A similar pattern prevailed in Southwest Asia, which at that time was inhabited by
                Iranian, Arab, and Turkic peoples, with a scattering of minority ethnic groups. Population was
                concentrated around cultivable areas, water resources, or grass pastures.

                South and East Asia showed a more complex dual set of patterns. The largest components consisted of
                the highly civilized lowland populations, long settled on their land and engaged in sedentary
                agriculture and handicraft manufacturing. Market towns and cities were scattered over the
                countryside, and many small port towns dotted the seacoasts. Population density was heaviest in the
                best agricultural lowlands, which had also been occupied the longest, such as the North China Plain,
                the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) valley, southern Japan, coastal Vietnam, the lowlands of Java, and
                the Ganges (Ganga) and Indus river valleys.Smaller components included the diverse ethnic groups
                scattered in wet deltaic lowlands, such as those of the Ganges, Irrawaddy, Chao Phraya, and Mekong
                rivers; the central plain of the island of Luzon in the Philippines; and northern Sumatra and the
                Malay Peninsula. Groups also were scattered throughout most of the hill and lower-mountain country.
                Their economies combined hunting and gathering with sedentary or shifting cultivation (the
                cultivation of new land for each successive crop). Generally, those less-densely populated areas had
                small populations scattered in village settlements that were sustained by subsistence economies;
                limited handicraft manufacturing took place, and trade was confined to minor products. The Naga of
                northeastern India, the upland Karen of Myanmar, and the Hmong (also known as Miao) of Laos
                exemplified that lifestyle. Toward the end of the 18th century, European colonial efforts were
                beginning to integrate the production systems of eastern Eurasia into patterns of world trade.
                Supplying Europe with raw materials, which was to characterize the early 20th century, also
                commenced at that time.</p>

                By the 20th century, great changes had taken place in both the ethnic patterns and the associated
                lifestyles in Asia. Many smaller ethnic groups faced challenges to their autonomy as the spread of
                nation-states and economic exchange across the continent integrated them into larger social,
                political, and economic units. By the mid-20th century, the Soviet Union and China had extended
                their economic and political control over Siberia and Central Asia, the former colonial lands of
                South Asia had achieved independent statehood, and the component territories of the old Ottoman
                Empire had been reshaped into the modern countries of Southwest Asia. Meanwhile, the introduction of
                modern forms of transportation, communication, and finance integrated even formerly remote regions
                into national and global economies. Many of the hundreds of small ethnic groups were absorbed into
                the populations of nation-states, many old languages declined, and many formerly distinctive ways of
                life persisted only as remnants or artificially preserved societies.Political and economic
                predominance in nearly all of the new or expanded nation-states lay in the hands of one or more of
                the country’s ethnic groups. In the former Soviet Union and present-day Russia, ethnic Russians have
                been the dominant group. In China, Han (ethnic Chinese) hold most positions of power. In Indonesia,
                the Javanese have dominated political life, while power in other Southeast Asian countries has
                tended to remain with lowland peoples such as the Vietnamese in Vietnam and the Burmans in Myanmar;
                in those areas, upland tribal peoples such as the Hmong (in Vietnam) or the Shan (in Myanmar) often
                face disadvantages.

                The expansion of dominant ethnic groups has steadily restricted the territory available for older,
                simpler societies; and modern economic patterns have largely replaced earlier practices. It is still
                possible to identify the region in which the Yukaghir formerly lived as a separate culture group in
                eastern Siberia, but—for the several hundred Yukaghir who remain—political absorption,
                acculturation, and internal social decay have made the classic description of the group largely a
                historic one. Many former horse-riding, tent-dwelling, sheep-herding Karakalpak now drive tractors
                on the grain farms established by the Soviets, live in permanent villages, and speak Russian in
                public. Some men of the Chota Nagpur hill region of eastern India, who formerly engaged in hunting
                and practiced shifting cultivation, now work in the steel mills of Jamshedpur. By the late 20th
                century, the remnant Ainu, indigenous people of northern Japan, had largely been gathered into
                “cultural villages,” where their traditional wood carving and bear dances attracted a flow of
                tourists from other parts of Japan. Since then, however, the Ainu have actively pursued a cultural
                revival.</p>

                There is a great variation in population growth rates in Asia. Growth rates are falling in most
                Asian countries, but, even so, the United Nations has estimated that the continent’s population will
                exceed five billion by 2050—an increase of more than two-fifths from its estimated population in
                2000. There have also been predictions that India’s population will overtake China’s by 2030.
                Advanced Japan has an essentially static, but aging, population. Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Georgia
                have falling populations. The Arab countries of the Middle East, however, have some of the world’s
                highest population growth rates: more than 3 percent annually in some Arab countries. In part that
                reflects Muslim traditions, which have frowned on birth control and granted women less control over
                fertility. The next fastest-growing area is South Asia. The growth rate in the region’s largest
                country, India, though high, fell significantly during the 1990s, as did that in Bangladesh,
                although Pakistan maintained a somewhat higher rate of growth. The growth rate in Southeast Asia as
                a whole is somewhat lower, but it varies widely by country, with the highest rate in Laos and a
                relatively low rate in Thailand. East Asia, currently the most populous region, has a relatively low
                growth rate. That reflects not only Japan’s static population, where the fertility rate has actually
                dropped below the replacement level, but also the impact of China’s one-child policy, which
                contributed to an annual growth rate of less than 1 percent by the late 1990s. The regions with the
                lowest growth rates are North and Central Asia, where the populations in some countries are actually
                declining. Those variations across Asia reflect differences in culture, religion, education,
                economic development, and government policies.Most non-Islamic Asian countries, aware of the adverse
                impact high rates of population growth have on economic growth and social progress, embarked on
                official birth-control programs, which met with considerable success. Japan’s program perhaps has
                been the most effective. In existence since World War II, it includes well-publicized
                family-planning services, legalized abortion, and the provision of contraceptive devices. Indeed,
                the birth rate in Japan dropped so dramatically that the median age of the population has increased,
                and about 2010 the population actually began declining. In China fines and other penalties have been
                imposed on parents who have a second child without government approval, although by the early 21st
                century China had gradually begun to ease its one-child policy. South Korea, Taiwan, India, and Sri
                Lanka offer family-planning and birth-control services. Similar policies and plans exist in some
                Islamic countries, such as Pakistan, but have less overt public support. The Southeast and Southwest
                Asian countries lag behind in formal programs, but public consciousness and basic planning have
                grown.

                In some Asian countries, particularly India and Sri Lanka, as well as Pakistan and a few other
                predominantly Muslim countries, males outnumber females in all age groups, while other countries,
                such as China, show a marked surplus of males in most age groups. The sex ratio in those places
                differs from that found in Western industrial countries, and there is controversy about its cause.
                In many Asian societies there is a cultural preference for sons, and there is evidence that—at least
                at times—female fetuses in certain Asian countries have been selectively aborted. In some countries
                social attitudes may account for the difference in mortality rates of the sexes after birth, through
                preferential treatment and feeding of males, for example. In China the one-child policy created an
                imbalance in favour of male children. In many countries marriage still occurs earlier than in
                Western countries, and that fact may further tip the overall balance in favour of males because of
                the relatively high mortality rate of young mothers in childbirth.</p>

                While the economies of most Asian countries can be characterized as developing, there is enormous
                variation among them. The continent contains one of the world’s most economically developed
                countries, Japan, and several that are impoverished, such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Nepal. This
                variation has a regional dimension. Most of the countries of Southwest Asia fall within one of the
                middle-income categories as defined by the World Bank. Exceptions are Israel and the Persian Gulf
                states of Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which are considered high-income. Most of the
                countries of North and Central Asia fall within the low-income category, except Russia (Siberia),
                Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, all considered lower-middle-income. Likewise, all the countries of South
                Asia are considered low-income, apart from lower-middle-income Sri Lanka. Except for China and North
                Korea, which are considered low-income, East Asia is the most prosperous part of the continent. Most
                countries in this region are considered upper-middle-income, and Japan is considered high-income.
                China, which has experienced dramatic rates of economic growth since the late 20th century, may be
                poised to achieve lower-middle-income status. Many of the countries of Southeast Asia have likewise
                achieved high rates of growth and have moved into one of the middle-income categories or even, in
                the case of Singapore and Brunei, into the high-income category. Exceptions are Myanmar (Burma),
                Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, which remain within the low-income group.The explanation for these
                varying degrees of development is complex and multifaceted. Before World War II, Japan was alone in
                Asia in having developed a domestically owned, financed, and managed industrial base. Other
                countries relied on the exchange of basic raw materials and commodities such as rubber, tea, and tin
                for industrial products, often supplied by Western colonial powers. Since then different countries
                have adopted different strategies to achieve economic development. From the 1950s through the ’70s,
                the continent’s two largest countries—India and China—both adopted policies of self-sufficiency and
                internal development, limiting the role of external trade and investment. During that period,
                countries also chose between socialism—i.e., relying on state ownership of economic enterprises as a
                pathway to development—and capitalist development based on private ownership. The contrasting
                success of these two economic systems can be seen nowhere better than in the Korean peninsula, where
                capitalist South Korea has achieved a relatively high level of prosperity, while socialist North
                Korea has experienced repeated famines and economic difficulties. The economic success of capitalist
                Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore was undoubtedly one of the reasons why China moved during the 1980s
                and ’90s from state socialism to increasing reliance on private ownership and capitalist economic
                relations, even though the Chinese Communist Party retained absolute political
                power.Industrialization has provided the primary means of economic development. For some economies
                this has meant manufacturing consumer goods, such as electronics, footwear, or clothing, often as
                contractors for foreign firms. The countries that have experienced the most dramatic growth,
                however, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, have provided state support for domestically
                owned firms, invested heavily in education, and moved from low-cost manufacturing to more advanced
                economic activities generating greater returns. For countries such as Saudi Arabia, other Persian
                Gulf states, and Brunei, growth has come from exploiting valuable petroleum and natural gas
                reserves—but in general these countries have found it hard to develop economic sectors independent
                of oil production for future sustainable growth.

                Despite these changes, a majority of people in Asia are still engaged in agriculture, usually
                working small peasant holdings. In China and India, agriculture is still by far the biggest
                employer, though it provides a diminishing share of gross domestic product. The greatest poverty in
                these countries is thus usually found in rural areas. But the acceleration of urbanization since the
                mid-20th century has meant that increasing numbers of rural peasants are leaving the land for the
                cities.

                The population shift from rural areas to the cities in Asia is an unprecedented migration. In China,
                systems of residential permits aim to control the flow, but many peasants move to Chinese cities
                even without official permits. In Indonesia, by contrast, there is effectively no control, although
                there are policies to try to diffuse the location of new industrial employment. As industry has
                become increasingly mechanized, it has often not provided much proportional growth in employment. It
                is the service sectors of the expanding cities that have shown the fastest growth in employment in
                recent years. In the poorer countries much of the employment growth is in what is known as the
                informal sector—a term referring to small, often family-owned businesses operating outside state
                regulation or control and mainly engaged in petty services or petty manufacturing.

                To date, increases in food production have allowed most countries to feed their growing populations,
                but the balance between population growth and food supply has been delicate. The dominant methods by
                which the major grain crops are produced remain labour-intensive. Crop yields vary greatly
                throughout Asia. For example, rice production per acre in Bangladesh is about half that of South
                Korea. Only about one-fifth of Asia’s land is arable, and it has been increasingly difficult to
                expand production by extending the amount of cultivated land, although in some areas, such as
                western Indonesia, forest has continued to be cleared for colonization. In most tropical and
                subtropical parts of Asia, cropping intensity has risen—i.e., arable land increasingly has been
                cultivated for more than one crop (and in some areas, such as Bangladesh, sometimes even three
                crops) each year. Major efforts to increase production have occurred through the so-called Green
                Revolution, which involved introducing hybrid seed strains that have been responsive to chemical
                fertilizers. This technology has required controlled water supplies and has led to increases in
                irrigation and the use of pesticides. Mechanization has been important for some crops, such as wheat
                and corn (maize), but in general it has not been so important for rice growing. It is thought that a
                more significant barrier to further agricultural development has been the uneven distribution of
                land. This problem has been particularly acute in the poorer countries of Asia. While governments
                have made concerted efforts to produce workable land-reform programs, progress has been slow; this
                has been particularly conspicuous in the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines. In the socialist
                countries, land reform was attempted through collectivization, but in general land has been given
                back to peasants to farm individually. Anxiety that the growth potential of the Green Revolution has
                been slackening has contributed to arguments for introducing genetically modified organisms. Asian
                countries, however, have responded cautiously to such proposals.Asian economic interdependence grew
                significantly during the late 20th century as a product of trade, investment, and better access to
                information. Japanese investment has dominated much of East and Southeast Asia. Formal organization
                of the regional economy remains relatively weak, although the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
                (ASEAN) has worked reasonably well. For most of these countries, however, trade with other Southeast
                Asian countries has grown less quickly than trade with Japan. In 1995 the South Asian Association
                for Regional Co-operation proclaimed a South Asian Free Trade Area as one of its policy goals, but
                such a zone has not yet been realized. The Persian Gulf countries have sometimes achieved sufficient
                unity to act together through the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC; which
                includes non-Asian members) to control oil prices, but otherwise there has been little regional
                integration in Southwest Asia. Siberia, the Asian portion of Russia, suffered after the collapse of
                Soviet central planning in the early 1990s, and the Russian central government subsequently
                abandoned the region to manage on its own. The remote location and fierce climate have discouraged
                private investors from trying to exploit much of Siberia’s vast mineral and timber resources, except
                for the heavily developed petroleum and gas deposits of western Siberia.</p>

                The immensity of the continent and its geologic diversity explain the mineral wealth of Asia, which
                includes reserves of almost every important mineral. Abundant reserves of coal, petroleum, natural
                gas, uranium, iron, bauxite, and other ores are either being exploited or awaiting development; much
                wealth also remains to be surveyed. However, at times the inaccessibility of some of these reserves
                has constituted a barrier to their exploitation.</p>

                Asia has enormous reserves of coal, amounting to nearly three-fifths of the world’s total, but they
                are unevenly distributed. The largest reserves are found in Siberia, the Central Asian republics,
                India, and especially China; Indonesia, Japan, and North Korea have smaller but nevertheless
                economically important reserves. China has chiefly high-grade coal reserves. Every province has at
                least one coalfield, but the largest reserves are in Shanxi and Shaanxi in the Ordos River basin in
                the north. Sichuan, Shandong, and the Northeast (Fushun, in Liaoning province) are old
                coal-producing regions with good reserves, and a coal-mining area with large deposits has been
                developed in central Anhui, north of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). Mines in Ningxia and Gansu
                supply northern industrial plants, but their reserves are not clearly known. The long-known reserves
                in western Hebei are being exploited.

                Enormous coal reserves are found in North and Central Asia, and some 200 fields have been worked
                throughout the region. Most of the known coal supplies of North Asia lie in Siberia, but the total
                extent and quality of Siberian deposits have not been fully explored. The Ural Mountains are not
                rich in coal, but there are some small fields of lower-grade coals. The Kuznetsk Basin in
                south-central Siberia has become a giant producer. The Minusinsk Basin in the central region of
                western Siberia, the Kansk region to the north along the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Cheremkhovo
                area west of Lake Baikal in south-central Siberia, and the Bureya River basin in the southeast also
                are the major areas of Siberian production. Many smaller deposits have been worked to supply local
                regions, such as the small and scattered fields north of Vladivostok and on Sakhalin Island in the
                Far East. The Qaraghandy fields in east-central Kazakhstan contain the largest deposits in Central
                Asia; during the Soviet period, however, mining was not expanded there after sources of better coals
                began to be worked in western Siberia. The Ekibastuz field, north of the main Qaraghandy fields,
                also is a producer of high-quality coal. Smaller deposits also are worked in Uzbekistan, as well as
                in the valleys of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Chinese and Indian economies in particular have
                depended heavily on coal, and their coal consumption has grown along with their industrial economies
                since the late 20th century. Concern has been raised by environmentalists about the possibility that
                increasing coal consumption in these two countries would raise global atmospheric carbon dioxide
                levels.</p>

                At least two-thirds of the world’s known crude oil and natural gas reserves are found in Asia; the
                proportion may prove higher as Siberia, the Caspian basin, and the seas of southeastern Asia are
                further explored. Many of the island chains bordering eastern Asia have geologic formations
                favouring petroleum accumulation, and oil fields—both on land and offshore—are in production in the
                Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo and in China, Brunei, and Malaysia. Western Asia has
                the largest known oil reserves, located in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Qatar, and the United
                Arab Emirates. Other regions in Southwest Asia have limited amounts of oil, and known petroleum
                reserves on the Indian subcontinent are small as well. However, significant deposits of natural gas
                were discovered in Bangladesh during the 1990s.Malaysia is the only important oil-producing area on
                the mainland of Southeast Asia, although offshore waters may yield production after further
                exploration; Vietnam also has some offshore potential. The area of the South China Sea has been
                actively tested, but disputes among the surrounding countries about sovereignty over the Spratly
                Islands has inhibited development. The Philippines is negligible as a producing region, and the
                petroleum production of Japan is also small. North and South Korea appear to have virtually no
                prospects of production, but China has a number of oil-producing fields in the provinces of Sichuan,
                Gansu, and Xinjiang and in the Northeast. The Qaidam Basin in northwestern Qinghai province also is
                a producing region. Some oil has been derived regularly from oil shales found in the Northeast, and
                natural gas is exploited in Sichuan and in the Northeast.

                Siberia produces more natural gas than Southwest Asia and is a significant oil producer as well. The
                flanks of the Ural Mountains have a number of large oil fields and small gas fields. The rich gas
                field in the northern Ob River basin at Berezovo indicates that the entire Ob basin may yield
                natural gas. In the east the Lena River basin, north of Yakutsk, also contains large gas reserves.

                Azerbaijan and the former Soviet republics of Central Asia also possess large deposits of oil and
                natural gas. Much of this is centred in the Caspian basin, particularly in areas claimed by
                Azerbaijan. The capital, Baku, has become a new world centre for oil exploration. The reserves,
                which the former Soviet Union hardly noticed, may prove to be substantial. Turkmenistan and
                Kazakhstan share in Caspian output. Uzbekistan has a major gas field at Gazli in the Kyzylkum Desert
                southeast of the Aral Sea and oil fields in the southeastern part of the country. Although the
                landlocked region is not as remote as Siberia, its oil and gas producers have debated whether to
                export production to the world market through Russia or to build pipelines across Iran to the
                Persian Gulf, across the politically unstable Caucasus region to the Black Sea, or to the
                Mediterranean ports of Turkey.</p>

                Many regions of Asia have deposits of iron ore, although not every country has its own domestic
                supply. South Korea, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and several smaller countries in Southwest Asia appear to
                have only small iron ore supplies. Japan has far less than is needed by its large iron and steel
                industry and depends largely on imported supplies. The Philippines exports ore. Malaysia produces a
                considerable volume. Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan have fair amounts of relatively low-grade ores,
                and Vietnam and Turkey have good ores in substantial volume. Indonesia and India both have large
                deposits of good iron ores that are reasonably distributed.

                Although China formerly was regarded as deficient in iron ores, huge quantities of varying grades of
                ores have been discovered that are widely distributed and often located close to coal supplies.
                Regional centres of ore mining, smelting, and fabrication are located at Anshan in Liaoning
                province; near Beijing; in southern Anhui, west of Shanghai; in central China, east of Wuhan; in
                southern Inner Mongolia, north of Baotou; in central western Gansu; and on Hainan Island, off the
                southern coast. Large iron ore deposits also occur near Chongqing. Iron ore in small local volumes
                is widely located in Guizhou and Yunnan in the southwest. China now ranks among the world’s major
                producers of iron ore.

                Iron ore long has been extracted from the Ural Mountains, and there appears to be a virtually
                unlimited supply of low-grade ore in the Qostanay Basin east of the Southern Urals in northwestern
                Kazakhstan and southwestern Siberia. Large deposits of medium-grade ore have been found northwest of
                Lake Baikal, close to the Cheremkhovo coal deposits. Smaller deposits have been located in several
                locations in eastern Siberia. In Central Asia the main deposits are found in eastern Kazakhstan.</p>

                In Siberia, production is mainly from the Kuznetsk Basin. Japan’s once widespread copper ore
                reserves are no longer worked, and the Philippines has limited reserves. China has deposits in
                Gansu, Hebei, Anhui, and Hubei, but production is insignificant. Turkey, Myanmar, Malaysia,

                Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, and Yunnan province in China also have deposits of tin. Siberia has
                substantial reserves in Transbaikal and also in the Sikhote-Alin Mountains of the Far East.

                The largest reserves of lead and zinc in Asia are located in the Kuznetsk Basin of Siberia and in
                central and eastern Kazakhstan. China also has abundant deposits of zinc and lead ores, and North
                Korea has important lead resources.

                Many Asian countries have produced gold from alluvial stream deposits in past centuries, and some

                Asia’s water resources constitute a vast potential, both for generating hydroelectricity and for
                irrigating crops. Water is important for irrigation in many Asian regions that are either arid (as
                in much of Central and Southwest Asia), subject to long dry seasons because of pronounced monsoonal
                (seasonal) variation in rainfall (as in much of South and Southeast Asia), or subject to seasonal
                high water and floods (for example, from the spring snowmelt in Siberia, the Himalayas, and the
                mountains of Central Asia). Other regions, such as Indonesia, are particularly susceptible to
                longer-term climate variation, such as that caused by the El Niño phenomenon.The management of water
                has been a prime focus of Asian peoples since the earliest civilizations were established on the
                continent; perhaps the most graphic expression of this is the Islamic tradition of building a garden
                in the desert, complete with splashing fountains. As ever-larger dams have been built, however,
                resistance has increased from opponents concerned with the environmental and social harm that such
                dams can cause.

                Siberian rivers have an excellent hydroelectric potential, for when dammed they provide low falls
                with an enormous flow volume. However, the extreme cold temperatures of winter freeze lakes and
                streams and keep water levels low for much of the year, which hinders exploitation. The Far East,
                with its abundant precipitation and great differences in water level, has an immense generating
                potential, although the remoteness of eastern Siberia has discouraged industrialization.

                East Asia’s waterpower potential varies by region. Japan, a mountainous country whose short rivers
                have steep drops but relatively small volumes of water flow, has already harnessed much of its
                hydroelectric potential; generating capacity, however, is increased by heavy rains, particularly in
                summer. The waterpower potential of northern China is extremely limited because the flow of the
                Huang He and other northern rivers is erratic and because these rivers carry heavy volumes of silt.
                The hydroelectric potential of China south of the Qin (Tsinling) Mountains, however, is great.The
                Yangtze River has considerable waterpower potential. The Three Gorges Dam project on the central
                Yangtze near Yichang, construction of which officially began in 1994 and was largely completed in
                2006, has been the largest and most ambitious attempt to harness this potential. The dam created a
                vast reservoir and locks that facilitate ship transport upstream and is intended to control the
                river’s periodic flooding. The dam also has the capacity to generate 22,500 megawatts of
                hydroelectricity. However, the project attracted considerable controversy. Flooding the river basin
                submerged numerous cities, towns, and villages and several sites of archaeological and cultural
                interest, and it necessitated resettling more than a million people in a region with a shortage of
                available land.

                The hydroelectric and irrigation potential in South Asia also varies by region. In Pakistan nearly
                all agriculture depends on the Indus River and its tributaries in the Punjab, and the waters of the
                Indus basin are highly regulated, with numerous barrages and canals providing water for irrigation.
                The Western Ghats, which slope down abruptly to the western maritime plains, would theoretically
                allow dams to harness water flowing down the steep slope; however, the rivulets that rise on the
                summit have an insignificant volume of flow in winter. Rivers on the eastern slope of the Deccan
                plateau, such as the Mahanadi and the Godavari, lend themselves to the construction of low dams with
                great volumes of flow, as also do the Himalayan rivers entering the Gangetic Plain. Nearly all of
                the highly seasonal rivers of peninsular India have been dammed. One exception was the Narmada
                River, where work began in the 1990s on the first in a series of 30 large dams. Construction of
                these dams has been vigorously opposed by environmentalists both within India and
                internationally.The Himalayan ranges represent one of the world’s greatest “water towers,” with rich
                possibilities for utilizing steep drops for generating hydroelectricity. During the summer monsoon
                the heaviest precipitation on Earth falls there on the highest mountains. Nepal has a vast
                theoretical hydroelectric potential. Environmentalists worry that earthquakes in this seismically
                active region could cause the dams to fail. Some also argue that large dams might themselves
                instigate earthquakes, because the weight of the water in reservoirs could press on faults in the
                mountains and because water under pressure lubricates faults. Engineers, however, believe that they
                can address these problems. An obstacle to such development is the fact that the Ganges
                (Ganga)–Brahmaputra basin spans five countries—China, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. Power,
                irrigation water, and flood control would benefit India and Bangladesh most, but the sites of the
                projects would be mostly in Nepal and Bhutan.

                In Southeast Asia the Mekong passes through six countries; again development has been stalled by
                regional political difficulties. In arid West Asia water politics are highly serious, as shown by
                the tensions among Syria, Israel, and Jordan over the use of the Jordan River. Another dispute,
                between Iraq and Syria on the one hand and upstream Turkey on the other, concerns the Tigris and
                Euphrates rivers, whose headwaters lie in Turkey. Turkey had already built several dams, including
                the Atatürk Dam, on the two rivers, and construction has been underway on two more dams on the
                Euphrates, at Birecik and Kargamış, since the 1990s. Iraq and Syria have objected strongly to both
                projects, because they feared that the water supply would be reduced, that they would not be able to
                control water-flow timing, and that the quality of water would be diminished. Concern was also
                raised that water issues might give rise to future armed conflicts within the region.

                Asia’s vastness and widely varying climatic conditions have produced the enormous diversity of life
                described in the discussions of plant and animal life. The distribution of economically valuable
                species, however, is highly uneven. The Arctic north of the continent and large areas of the central
                mountain massif—known as “the roof of the world”—are practically barren. In addition, even where
                there is water—and nowhere is water conservation pursued more carefully than in Asia—there are still
                many areas of undrained swamp. Conservationists, who believe these swamps are resources in their own
                right, hope that they will remain undrained. The continent’s naturally occurring biological
                resources—combined with the produce of intensive crop cultivation and widespread animal
                husbandry—constitute a large portion of its total economic output.

                Much of northern Siberia, south of the Arctic Circle, is covered by commercially exploitable
                coniferous and mixed forest. The great deciduous forests of northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand,
                Malaysia, and Indonesia contain teak and other valuable hardwoods, as well as bamboo. Mangrove
                forests line the waters of the Ganges and Irrawaddy deltas and many small stretches of coast along
                the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, and the Philippines. But in the Indian subcontinent lowland, forest
                has given way to cultivated land as population has expanded; agriculture has similarly reduced the
                natural forest areas of China to insignificance, except in the Northeast. Japan, on the other hand,
                is relatively heavily forested in relation to its area and population, although much of the present
                cover is planted forest. At one time, more than half of the Philippines was heavily forested, but
                tree cover in those areas—particularly in the good commercial forests—has been reduced considerably.
                Interest in the genetic resources of the forests is increasing. India’s neem tree, for example,
                produces an insecticide, used by farmers for generations, that is now being exploited
                commercially.Grasslands in uncultivated steppe and semidesert areas form the other class of
                economically significant vegetation. These regions are the homeland of numerous animal species
                important to humans, such as the horse, and they continue to support huge livestock populations.

                Domesticated animals—principally sheep and goats, but also cattle, poultry, and pigs in agricultural
                areas—are the most economically important animal species. Hides, wool, and dairy products are of
                great economic significance in many areas. In Central Asia the horse and the yak traditionally are
                the riding animal and the beast of burden, respectively; in Arabia the camel is both. Reindeer herds
                are kept in the northern tundra of Siberia, where they feed on mosses and shrubs. In India cattle
                are especially prized as sources of milk and butter, and the oxcart is still ubiquitous in rural
                areas. In India, Myanmar, and Thailand elephants work as draft animals in the lumbering industry;
                particularly in Southeast Asia the water buffalo is an important draft animal as well as a source
                for milk and butter.

                Among Asia’s populations of wild animals, the valuable fur-bearing mammals of Siberia have long been
                hunted. North of the Himalayas, game birds such as ptarmigans, grouse, plovers, and various kinds of
                waterfowl are found. South of the Himalayas, pigeons, pheasants, and other game birds are taken.
                Various kinds of hawks and falcons, trained to hunt, have their habitat in Arabia and other parts of
                Asia.Fish and other sea creatures and various kinds of crustaceans and mollusks are heavily
                exploited by the populations of East and Southeast Asia. The coastal areas of India, Bangladesh, and
                Thailand are being developed for export shrimp farming on a large scale. Numerous freshwater
                species—such as the sturgeon in the Caspian Sea and the rivers of Siberia, which is prized for its
                caviar—are also commercially significant, although the Caspian is threatened with polluted water
                from the Volga and by contaminants and spills from the oil industry. The Indus has its own species
                of blind dolphin, and the great rivers of South Asia are home to the giant mahseer fish, threatened
                by pollution, overfishing, and habitat loss.

                The utilization of Asia’s natural resources has depended, to a large extent, not only on the
                development of technology but also on political circumstances. Thus, until the end of World War II
                and the beginning of the process of decolonization in Asia, most Asian countries were not free to
                develop their own natural resources independently and without reference to the economic interest of
                a colonial power. Cultural attitudes also have affected the utilization of resources. In India
                cultural taboos prohibit the slaughter of cattle either for food or to conserve resources when the
                animals are no longer productive.The value of natural resources also varies with the prevailing
                technology. For example, by applying new technology to the production of cereals, the same area of
                land can give greatly increased yields. Modern technology has enabled improvements in many other
                areas—e.g., in Japanese production of silk or cultured pearls. Technology also may make it possible
                to exploit mineral wealth that previously was unusable because it was inaccessible or juxtaposed
                with other minerals.

                Asia extracts an immense wealth of minerals, of which its mineral fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural
                gas—are of greatest value. The largest Asian coal producers are China and Russia (Siberia), followed
                by India, Kazakhstan, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan. Considerably smaller quantities of coal
                are mined in a number of other countries. The Arab countries of Southwest Asia collectively are the
                principal producers of petroleum in the world. The major Middle Eastern mines are in Saudi Arabia,
                the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Kuwait, Oman, and Iraq. Russian Siberia is also a major petroleum
                producer, as are China, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The biggest supplier of natural gas is Siberia, and
                the Central Asian republics, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran are also
                important.The largest producers of iron ore and ores for ferroalloys are China, Siberia, India,
                Iran, Kazakhstan, and North Korea. Together these six account for almost all of the ore mined on the
                continent. India and China are among the major world producers of manganese ore and between them
                account for virtually all of Asia’s output. Asia’s biggest producer of chromite is Kazakhstan,
                followed by Turkey, India, and Iran. Some tungsten is mined in China, Central Asia, North and South
                Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar. Nickel is extracted in Indonesia, Siberia, China, and the Philippines.
                Central Asia has become an increasingly important producer of many of the ferroalloys.

                Asia is one of the world’s main producers of tin-in-concentrates (i.e., tin ore that has been
                partially processed to increase the proportion of tin in it), providing more than half of the
                world’s total output. The most important Asian tin producers are China, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
                There is also considerable production of copper ore in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the Philippines,
                China, and Indonesia.

                The bauxite produced in Asia represents only a small part of total world production, and China,
                India, Siberia, and Kazakhstan are the most important Asian producers. China and Siberia are among
                the world’s leading producers of gold, and Uzbekistan and the Philippines are also important. Asia
                accounts for more than half of the world’s output of graphite, mostly from China and South Korea.

                Logs are exported from China, Siberia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Myanmar to industrialized and
                timber-deficient countries, especially Japan. Thailand and Myanmar produce special varieties of
                timber such as teak. Thai teak is also exported to other parts of the world. Malaysia and Indonesia
                are among the world’s leading producers of commercial hardwoods. Although output from Philippine
                forests has been reduced, valuable hardwoods and the soft “Philippine mahogany” are still
                produced.Wood in the enormous forestland of Siberia ranges from pine around the Bratsk area to a
                mixture of pine, larch, aspen, birch, and other species in the region south of Lake Baikal. Logging
                and transport operations are highly mechanized and have been facilitated by a road-building program.

                Bamboos are an important component of wet-evergreen, moist-deciduous, and dry-deciduous forests in
                the tropical parts of Southeast Asia. At higher elevations and in temperate climates of Asia—as in
                Bhutan, China, Japan, and Nepal—many of the genera found in tropical parts are represented by
                different species, and other genera are common in China and Japan. Pure bamboo forests are common on
                slopes where temporary cultivation has been practiced in Myanmar, Bangladesh, and other areas.

                The exploitation of Asian fisheries increased during the late 20th century. Japan has created a
                well-organized fishing fleet that can go nearly anywhere in search of catches, although it has been
                accused of environmental insensitivity, because the techniques used to catch tuna have also killed
                many dolphins and turtles. Freezing and canning fish products have allowed international trade to
                increase dramatically. In some countries freshwater fish are an important component of the diet of
                the local people; raising fish in culturally controlled ponds is significant in southern China,
                Indonesia, and the Philippines. Fish from big delta regions such as the Ganges in Bangladesh provide
                local populations with a valuable source of protein. Overall, China catches the world’s greatest
                tonnage; however, Thailand has become one of the world’s most important fish exporters, largely
                because of its shrimp and prawn farming.Raising sheep and goats for meat and wool is especially
                important in China, India, Pakistan, and Iran; these animals also are raised in nearly all the other
                countries of Asia, although the sheep population of Southeast Asia is small. Seminomadic pastoralism
                is practiced on the steppelands of Central Asia, as it is in parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,
                and Saudi Arabia. Angora goats are herded in Anatolian Turkey to provide the silky mohair for which
                they are noted. Silkworms are raised for their silk in China, Japan, India, and the Central Asian
                republics.

                While dairying is important in a few areas such as India, Pakistan, Central Asia, and Turkey, there
                is little large-scale beef-cattle farming; the Central Asian republics, however, have attempted to
                develop such patterns. Both China and Japan have discarded their traditional avoidance of milk
                products, and both countries have growing urban dairy industries. China, the world’s largest
                producer of pork, is the principal producer in Asia, with Japan a distant second. The poultry
                industry has made rapid strides, and the production of both eggs and broiling chickens has gathered
                much momentum. Feed availability for poultry is one of the major factors limiting the sector’s
                growth and development. Straw, obtained from rice crops, is the primary fodder for livestock in
                southern Asia, with cattle feed usually supplemented by concentrates such as oil cake.In spite of
                the large number of cattle and sheep in the region, the production of hides and skins is only slowly
                reaching internationally significant levels. For many tanneries the quality of flaying and curing
                has to be improved.

                By far the greater part of Asia remains uncultivated, primarily because climatic and soil conditions
                are unfavourable. Conversely, in the best growing areas an extraordinarily intensive agriculture is
                practiced, made possible by irrigating the alluvial soils of the great river deltas and valleys. Of
                the principal crops cultivated, rice, sugarcane, and, in Central Asia, sugar beets require the most
                water. Legumes, root crops, and cereals other than rice can be grown even on land watered only by
                natural precipitation.

                The most important modern development in Asian agriculture has been the introduction of new
                high-yielding strains of cereals. Several Asian countries have utilized this technology, and the
                yield per acre for cereals has increased substantially since the late 1960s. These improved yields
                can be attributed to partnership between international organizations, such as the International Rice
                Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, and national agricultural research stations. Thus, in
                the case of rice, countries have adapted the IRRI strains to local conditions and have implemented
                their own seed improvement programs and extension (advisory) services to farmers. Access to a
                reliable water supply has been crucial to the new agricultural technology, which has also required
                using fertilizer in conjunction with the improved cereal seeds that have been developed. Huge
                irrigation projects in southern Siberia, Central Asia, and Pakistan have been rapidly altering
                traditional agricultural patterns

                Rice is the staple food crop for most Asians. Asia produces some 90 percent of the world’s total
                supply of rice. Except in the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Siberia, Central Asia, and
                Malaysia, rice occupies more land area than any other single crop. The total proportion of land
                under rice cultivation, as compared with total arable land, is highest in Vietnam, Bangladesh, and
                Sri Lanka; it varies between one-fourth and half in most Asian countries outside the Middle East,
                Central Asia, and Siberia. In spite of this, many countries (among them Sri Lanka and Bangladesh)
                are not self-sufficient in rice. Thailand, Pakistan, and Vietnam are notable rice exporters.The
                black-earth (chernozem) belt across southern Siberia is cultivated with several grains, of which
                wheat is the most important. Wheat is also the dominant crop in Central Asia (notably Kazakhstan),
                the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Grain crops, chiefly wheat, are cultivated in North
                China—where soybeans are also grown—and in Japan. Barley is grown in China and India, among other
                countries. Corn (maize) is raised in China, Siberia, Central Asia, India, the Philippines, Thailand,
                North Korea, and other countries. India, China, Pakistan, and Central Asia also grow sorghum and
                millet. Intensive use of water resources from wells and from river-fed irrigation systems has
                enabled grain crops to be raised in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and northern India.

                The continent produces a variety of tropical and subtropical fruit, mainly for domestic consumption.
                Transport facilities, where available, can be used only for limited distances. In view of the
                climatic conditions and the general lack of refrigerated transport, consumption tends to be seasonal
                and confined to areas close to centres of production. Among the main varieties of fruit produced are
                bananas, mangoes, apples, oranges and other citrus fruits, pineapples, papayas, and some
                specialities such as mangosteen (a dark reddish brown fruit), litchi (a grape-shaped fruit in a
                brittle red rind), and durian (a large oval fruit with a prickly rind, a soft pulp, and a
                distinctive odour). Citrus fruit is produced in the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea, in
                Transcaucasia, and in China and Japan. Taiwan, the Philippines, and Malaysia export bananas to
                Japan.Except in a few countries—such as the Philippines, Taiwan, and Malaysia, which grow and can
                pineapples for export—canning surplus fruit has been developed only to a limited extent. In view of
                the tremendous potential for greater fruit production, it is possible to increase canning of both
                fruits and fruit juices for export.

                The same factors affect the production of vegetables. Vegetables are grown mainly for local
                consumption, and only tubers can be transported over distances and stored for any period of time.
                Taiwan has had success canning mushrooms and asparagus, and both products have become leading
                exports.

                Asia is noted for several plantation cash crops, of which the most important are tea, rubber, palm
                oil, coconuts, and sugarcane. Jute, a commercial fibre, though it has decreased in significance,
                remains a major export crop of Bangladesh. Cotton is important to the states of Central Asia and is
                also a major crop in India and Pakistan. Rubber was brought to Asia from Brazil in the 19th century;
                the major producers are Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, with lesser amounts from India, China,
                and the Philippines. Palm oil has become important in Indonesia and Malaysia. Tea is grown on
                commercial plantations in the uplands of India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia; and China, Taiwan, and
                Japan produce several types of tea on smallholdings. Coconuts are an important crop in the
                Philippines, Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. India, the world’s leader in sugarcane production,
                grows primarily for domestic use, whereas the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan produce for both
                domestic consumption and export. Tobacco is grown widely, notably in China, India, Turkey, Central
                Asia, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Date palms are cultivated, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula.
                Licorice is grown in Turkey. A large variety of spices are grown in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
                and Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia.

                Industrial development in Asia has been remarkable since the end of World War II. Most spectacular
                was Japan’s emergence as a global manufacturing superpower in the first postwar decades, but more
                recently the focus has been on countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Nonetheless,
                Asia’s industrial output is still far less than its proportion of world population. Although heavy
                industry has been important to the economies of the larger Asian countries, light manufacturing has
                been more conspicuous. In the lesser-developed and newly industrialized countries, labour-intensive
                industries have remained the most important. Medium-technology industries have been significant in
                many Asian economies regardless of their stage of development. Unequal regional development is a
                political problem in large countries such as China and India. Parts of western India are developing
                rapidly, while the east stagnates; similarly, China’s prosperous coastal belt is outstripping inland
                areas.

                The wide variety of mineral resources in Asia provides the basis for several metallurgical
                industries. Some, as in Russia (Siberia), are based on local resources, while others, as with
                Japan’s steel industry, rely on imported ores. The major producers of steel are China and Japan,
                respectively first and second in the world; other important steel producers in Asia are Siberia,
                South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Turkey. Japan, China, South Korea, India, and Taiwan are the major
                steel consumers, although the consumption of steel is increasing in other countries. Japan, China,
                and India also are the region’s leading producers of metallurgical coke.The leading primary
                producers of aluminum in Asia are China, Russia, India, and the Persian Gulf countries, particularly
                Bahrain. There is also some production of copper, zinc, lead, and tin in Asia, with China and Japan
                leading in the production of zinc and lead and Malaysia in the production of tin. Japan, China, and
                India are leading consumers of tin.

                Japan produces every variety of engineering goods, from tankers and locomotives to miniaturized
                electronic equipment. Since World War II, India has also gradually diversified its engineering
                industries and now produces heavy capital goods (machines and tools used to manufacture other
                goods), various types of industrial machinery, prime movers (engines and other sources of motive
                power) and boilers, diesel engines, sewing machines, machine tools, agricultural machinery, and all
                types of electrical equipment. In addition, India produces radio receivers, metal manufactures,
                railway rolling stock, automobiles, bicycles, and precision instruments. China has also made
                considerable progress in the field of engineering industries. Other Asian countries have primarily
                concentrated on producing durable consumer goods. Manufacturing based on computer hardware,
                software, and information processing has grown fast in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and South
                Korea and has also established fast-growing enclaves in India—particularly around Bangalore and
                Mumbai (Bombay).

                The consumption of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers has greatly increased in Asia, largely
                because additional countries have begun to use the advanced techniques and improved seeds that have
                become available. The major consumers of fertilizers, per acre of arable land, have been Japan and
                South Korea. Because of their vast size and the increased use of fertilizers, India and China are,
                in absolute terms, among the major consumers. India has greatly increased its production, especially
                of ammonium sulfate, and has also experimented with fertilizers that have a much higher nitrogen
                content, such as urea. Production of phosphatic fertilizers has also been increased in Asia,
                especially in Indonesia.While Asia’s main sources of natural gas and crude oil lie in the Persian
                Gulf region, western Siberia and Central Asia, China, Malaysia, and Indonesia, the continent’s
                petrochemical industry is more widely distributed, with especially heavy concentrations in countries
                with skilled workforces and strong domestic demand for petrochemical products. Thus, the leading
                centres of petrochemical manufacturing in Asia are Japan, China, and Siberia. Saudi Arabia, the
                world’s leading crude oil producer, refines only slightly more petroleum than South Korea, which,
                like Japan, has to import nearly all of its crude oil and natural gas. Other countries with
                significant petrochemical industries are India, Iran, Indonesia, Singapore, the smaller Persian Gulf
                countries, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan.

                Asia also produces and consumes common chemicals such as caustic soda, soda ash, and sulfuric acid;
                Japan and China are the leading producers of these, followed by India.

                The textile industries, particularly cotton, have expanded greatly in Asia since World War II. China
                (including Hong Kong) is the world’s largest exporter of cotton textiles. Pakistan is another major
                exporter, while Japan, India, South Korea, Turkey, and Bangladesh also are prominent in the
                international market. The industry produces cotton yarn, cloth, and finished garments. There is also
                some processing of wool (both yarn and woven fabrics) in the region. China, Japan, India, and Turkey
                are among the main producers and consumers; China is Asia’s chief producer of woolen fabrics. South
                Korea, Japan, and India also have become major producers of woven rayon and acetate fabrics. South
                Korea and Japan have turned to noncellulose synthetic fibres, especially nylon, acrylic, and
                polyester, as well.Industries based on processing agricultural products—e.g., canning, food and
                beverage processing, and footwear manufacture—continue to be important in most Asian countries. The
                consumption of pulp and paper throughout the continent has grown steadily, largely because standards
                of living are higher. The major consumers are China, Japan, and India, and the major producers are
                China, Japan, Siberia, and India. Feedstock includes grasses and bamboos as well as timber.

                Pharmaceutical manufacture also has become important, although its development has varied from
                country to country. Japan, for example, has established a pharmaceutical industry, the research and
                development capabilities of which are comparable to those achieved in western Europe and the United
                States; whereas in many of the other Asian countries pharmaceutical manufacture consists of only
                fabricating products from basic drugs, imported in bulk, which are then marketed for domestic
                consumption or for export.

                Traditional cottage industries and handicrafts continue to play an important role in the economies
                of all Asian countries. They not only constitute major manufacturing activities in themselves but
                are also often the only available means to provide additional employment and raise the level of
                living for both rural and urban populations. In view of the growing world market for products of
                traditional Asian cottage industries and for Asian handicrafts, there is room for considerable
                expansion. During the 1990s significant improvements were made in marketing these products in
                wealthy countries. Some, however, have raised ethical questions about the use of child labour in
                some of these industries, such as carpet making in South Asia.

                The per capita consumption of energy in Asia outside the oil-producing countries of the Middle East
                is considerably lower than the world average. China is by far the largest producer in Asia. While
                Japan produces about half as much, it consumes more energy than China in per capita terms. India
                produces slightly less energy than Japan, but, with its vast population, its per capita consumption
                is much lower. In China and India coal is the dominant source of energy for generating electricity,
                but in both countries about one-sixth of the electricity supply comes from hydroelectric sources.
                Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan both largely depend on hydropower from the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges, and
                Sri Lanka also relies heavily on hydropower. Japan and South Korea are the only countries in Asia
                where a substantial portion of the electricity (about one-third) comes from nuclear power. China and
                India have nuclear power plants, but they contribute little to national supplies. Many countries of
                the Middle East have per capita energy-consumption figures considerably higher than the world
                average. Electricity there is generated using domestic oil and gas supplies.Geothermal power in Asia
                is most developed in Siberia, with plants at Makhachkala, Lake Baikal, and Kamchatka; Uzbekistan has
                a plant at Tashkent; and Japan has two small plants. The only other Asian country to use geothermal
                power is the Philippines. Small gas-turbine generating stations also have been installed in many
                countries. Pakistan uses natural gas for both thermal and gas-turbine generation. Bangladesh is
                expanding electricity generation from domestic gas supplies.

                The service sector has grown markedly in Asia since the mid-20th century, and in most countries it
                now constitutes the most important component of the economy. Service activities account for some
                three-fifths or more of the gross domestic product (GDP) of economically advanced countries such as
                Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore and exceed half of the GDP in countries such as South Korea and
                Thailand. In China the service sector’s proportion of the GDP jumped dramatically after the country
                reacquired sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau, both with economies that are based largely on
                services. Banking and other financial activities have grown significantly in importance, and Hong
                Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, and other major Asian cities have become integral parts of the global
                banking system; nearly all such cities also have stock exchanges.Tourism has developed considerably
                since World War II and has been a major component in the growth of the Asian service sector. There
                have been increases not only in the number of non-Asian visitors but also in the number of Asian
                travelers within Asia. The Japanese in particular have been avid tourists in Asia, notably in
                Southeast Asian countries. The most-visited places include Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, China,
                Singapore, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Syria, and Israel. Hong Kong and Singapore both have a large
                entrepôt trade and attract visitors partly because they are duty-free ports. The number of tourists
                visiting China has grown since that country began lifting travel restrictions in the 1970s. India
                and Thailand both have well-established tourist sectors, which cater to visitors not only of their
                historic cities and palaces but also of their coastal resorts; Thailand is also known for its sex
                trade. Nepal is a popular destination for trekkers in the Himalayas, while nearby Bhutan strictly
                rations the number of visitors it allows into the country. Parts of Indonesia, particularly Bali,
                have become popular with tourists from Australia and Europe, as reaching those destinations has
                become easier. Israel has a large and multifaceted tourist industry, while Turkey has become a major
                holiday resort for Europeans. Vietnam is emerging as a destination for tourists wishing to see less
                heavily visited countries. Siberia and Kamchatka have begun to attract travelers seeking wilderness
                experiences.

                style="padding-right: 12px;  text-align:center; position:relative; left:2px; bottom:280px; margin:0px;">
                In ancient times, regions of Asia had commercial relations among themselves as well as with parts of
                Europe and Africa. In the earliest days nomadic peoples traded over considerable distances, using
                barter as the medium of exchange. Particularly important in such trade were fine textiles, silk,
                gold and other metals, various precious and semiprecious stones, and spices and aromatic products.
                Trade between Europe and Asia expanded considerably during the Greek era (about the 4th century
                BCE), by which time various land routes had been well established connecting Greece, via Anatolia
                (Asia Minor), with the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. Further development of land and
                sea routes from the Mediterranean basin, especially to southern India, occurred during Roman times.
                This east-west trade flourished in the first four centuries CE but was subject to considerable
                vicissitudes in later centuries. During that period trade also expanded considerably to Southeast
                Asia and to China through what are now Malaysia and Cambodia.After Spain and Portugal, in the 15th
                century, became interested in discovering a direct sea route to Asia—an interest that led to the
                European discovery of the Western Hemisphere—the era of the great circumnavigators arrived in the
                16th century. Portugal was one of the first countries to attempt to establish a monopoly over the
                lucrative spice trade with the East, and it founded a network of trading outposts in Asia. The
                Spanish, meanwhile, established control over the Philippines. The Dutch and the British started
                similar enterprises at the beginning of the 17th century, each country establishing its own East
                India company. The British began by centring their activities on the Indian subcontinent and
                extended their control to Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Malaysia. The Dutch first
                concentrated on Ceylon but later expanded into and concentrated on Southeast Asia, particularly
                Indonesia. The French were able to establish only minor footholds on the Indian subcontinent, but
                their 19th-century penetration of the Indochinese Peninsula was more successful. Over time these
                European trading companies developed into colonial empires.The East India companies of Europe came
                seeking the exotic products of Asia: silks, cottons, and precious commodities such as spices and
                aromatic products. These products required the skilled labour of weavers and farmers or soil and
                climatic conditions unique to the region.As the East India companies developed and imposed colonial
                rule, a new pattern of trade emerged. Generally speaking, the colonial countries became the
                exporters of raw materials and imported the finished products from their colonial rulers. For
                example, Britain ceased importing finished cotton goods from India and instead imported raw cotton
                to be spun and woven in the new industrial mills. Cotton cloth was then exported back to India,
                where indigenous weavers lost their employment. Steel products from cutlery to railway locomotives
                were exported to Asian countries from Europe. During that period tea and tobacco also entered into
                international trade, and jute became a monopoly product of the Indian subcontinent. After the
                British went to war with China to block Chinese efforts to ban opium imports, opium was traded
                legally by British merchants from India to China and was a source of tax revenue for the government
                of India. From the 17th to the second half of the 19th century, Japan had limited trading relations
                primarily with Korea and China and prohibited trade with Western countries apart from a small Dutch
                trading post in southern Japan.The latter half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th
                constituted the heyday of colonial rule. By the first decade of the 20th century, Japan had emerged
                as a major military and naval power, and it gradually developed into an important trading partner
                with the rest of the world. The era that followed was that of the colonies’ struggle for political
                independence, which reached its climax immediately after World War II. Less than two decades after
                the end of the war, the great British, French, and Dutch empires had virtually ceased to exist in
                Asia.After independence many countries in Asia sought to develop industries of their own to produce
                substitutes for their former imports. This happened under both socialist and nonsocialist regimes. A
                few countries—Japan the most notable among them—lacking natural resources but endowed with an
                educated labour force, opted for promoting new industrial production for export instead of import
                substitution. In general this strategy has paid off better, particularly for Japan and the “four
                tigers”—Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. At the beginning of the 21st century nearly
                all countries were responding to the globalization of production by promoting exports and opening
                domestic markets to international competition to varying degrees. Such liberalization exposed those
                economies to the volatility of international markets, and there were major currency collapses and
                episodes of capital flight in the late 1990s. Although most Asian economies had begun to recover by
                2000, there was still a legacy of unemployment, poverty, and resentment for many.

                In view of the division of labour that existed between the colonial countries and the metropolitan
                powers in colonial days, it is not surprising that until the 1970s the economies of the independent
                countries of Asia often were more competitive than complementary. For some countries intraregional
                exports have amounted to only a small fraction of total exports. However, in East and Southeast Asia
                intraregional trade has grown in importance. Japan has assumed a prominent role in Asian trade, and
                South Korea, China, and Taiwan have also traded more heavily with other Asian countries. Because
                many of the countries of East and Southeast Asia have maintained substantial trade surpluses and
                because those regions as a whole have been net exporters, many of those countries have derived most
                of their imports from other Asian countries, while their main export market has often been outside
                the region, often in the United States.Asia is the biggest producer of rice in the world, and rice
                remains an important commodity of intraregional trade. It is an important export item for countries
                such as Thailand, Pakistan, and Vietnam.

                The countries of Transcaucasia and Central Asia, members of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
                still trade largely within the former Soviet bloc as a result of both history and location. However,
                those countries have also steadily increased trade with the countries of the European Union and with
                Turkey and Iran. The most important trading partners of Turkey and Cyprus are the countries of the
                European Union. Indeed, the chief trading partners of most South and Southwest Asian countries lie
                outside the region—in the European Union, North America, and East Asia.There has been an effort on
                the part of Asian countries to improve their trading position by joining organizations of commodity
                producers. Among these are the International Sugar Agreement, the Asian and Pacific Coconut
                Community, and the International Tea Committee. These organizations have been designed not so much
                to promote intraregional trade as to help stabilize the prices of primary products produced in Asia
                and exported to other parts of the world. The most prominent and occasionally successful of these
                groups is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is dominated by the major
                oil-producing countries of Southwest Asia.

                The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has fostered joint economic ventures among its
                member states and has worked to reduce trade barriers. Although some consider it the most successful
                of the Asian regional blocs, intrabloc trade accounts for less than one-third of its members’
                exports. Trade between India and Pakistan, which could be of great mutual benefit, has been hampered
                by poor political relations between the two countries. There are some hopes that the South Asian
                Association for Regional Co-operation will be able to implement a South Asian Free Trade Area by
                2015, although commerce between member countries remains small. The Gulf Cooperation Council
                embraces members from around the Persian Gulf. Trade within the bloc has not grown much, because the
                economies are too similar. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation has been more successful, but this
                group is intercontinental, not strictly Asian; it includes the middle-income countries of Southeast
                (including most ASEAN members) and East Asia as well as Pacific-coast countries in both North and
                South America.Exports from the Persian Gulf are still dominated by petroleum. Oil is Indonesia’s
                most important export, but it accounts for less than one-fourth of the country’s export earnings.
                However, apart from the countries of Central Asia, most other Asian countries now earn more from
                exports of manufactured goods than from any raw commodity. Bangladesh established a successful
                apparel industry within a decade. Local manufacturing firms—for example, automobile producers in
                Korea or Malaysia—increasingly have become part of multinational combines. China exports an
                extensive range of inexpensive consumer goods. One of India’s fastest-growing exports is software
                and data processing—since it has become possible for companies in Europe and North America to beam
                data by satellite for processing. The number of trained programmers in India, the relatively low pay
                scale, and above all the common use of English by educated people give India a comparative advantage
                over most other Asian countries in this international trade.

                Reference has already been made to the main transport systems that linked Asia and the Western
                world. Until the 19th century the land, or caravan, routes, supplemented by oceangoing vessels, were
                predominant. In the latter half of the 19th century there was a major shift to seagoing vessels.
                Rail and road transport has become important for moving passengers within individual states and for
                transporting bulk goods over longer distances. Concurrently, there has been considerable development
                of ports and harbours—including container facilities in the larger ports—which have been linked to
                their hinterlands by rail and road. Air transport has proved to be not only the speediest but also
                often the cheapest means of transport, especially for costly items of relatively small weight and
                bulk. Air transport has played a particularly important role in landlocked countries—such as
                Afghanistan, Nepal, and Laos—and in the opening up of relatively inaccessible and fragmented areas,
                such as Indonesia.Within Asian countries, diesel trucks, buses, and jeeps have been replacing draft
                animals for internal traffic, as roads and highways have been extended in most countries. Motorbikes
                and motorcycles have also become common in many areas for hauling goods short distances. Carts
                hauled by draft animals (mostly oxen or buffalo) are still used where roads are unpaved or poorly
                maintained, and they may be seen in large cities of the poorer regions.Inland navigation is
                important in certain countries; a good river and canal system is capable of carrying goods and
                passengers at small cost over considerable distances. Among the countries with well-developed inland
                water transport systems are Bangladesh, the countries of mainland Southeast Asia, and China. There
                are also great riverine ports such as Kolkata (Calcutta) in India, Yangon (Rangoon) in Myanmar,
                Bangkok in Thailand, and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Oceangoing ships can navigate the Mekong River
                to inland ports such as Phnom Penh, in Cambodia, and can sail up the Yangtze River to Wuhan, China.
                Ultimately, it may be possible to connect even Laos with the sea by improving navigation facilities
                on the Mekong. The Yangtze, Sungari, and Xi rivers of China provide a wide network of routes for
                motorized barges, supplementing traditional water transport.A number of pipelines have been
                constructed to move petroleum products, especially in Southwest Asia, western Siberia, and the
                Caucasus region. Pipelines have considerable advantages, such as economy and speed, but they also
                have the disadvantage of being subject to sabotage and to political vicissitudes when they cross
                international boundaries. For example, the war between Russian troops and rebels in Chechnya was
                partly about control over possible pipeline routes between the Caspian and Black seas.
