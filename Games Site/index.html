    <h1 class="section__title">The Seven Continents Game</h1>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Game Made by <span style="color: goldenrod;">Divyesh Idhate</span> in Python </h3>

    <p>
        This is a game made for educational purposes by me. It is made in Python using turtle library. It consists of a
        blank world mapand you are opt to enter the names of continents. The game progresses as you enter correct games.
        You can type <span style="color: goldenrod;">"Exit"</span> to end the game and the contitnents which were not
        inputted by you will be saved
        in a file <span style="color: goldenrod;">"continents_to_learn.csv"</span> so that students can review what they
        have missed out. The code
        for this project and be found in my repo:
        <a class="nav__links" href="https://github.com/codes-and-games/The_Continents_Games">The_Continents_Games</a>. The code was turned into exe and has been compressed in a rar
        file. Download the rar file and extract it and run <span style="color: goldenrod;">"The Seven Continents
            Game.exe"</span>. Happy Playing ðŸ˜‰!
